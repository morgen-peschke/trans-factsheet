## Medical Transition

**Medical transition decreases dysphoria, suicide attempts, and improves depression and anxiety. However, most research 
on this subject is very low quality, so we should be open to conducting better future research. 
Check out [this section](#srs-detransition) too.**

* [Murad et al. 10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473181)
    * Meta-analysis of **28 **studies on transition and hormones.
    * Sex reassignment/hormonal improvements:
        * **80%** of individuals reported significant improvement in **dysphoria**
        * **78%** of individuals reported significant improvement in **psychological symptoms**
        * **72%** of individuals reported significant improvement in **sexual function**
        * **Positive results across the board, EVEN IN 15-YEAR FOLLOWUPS**
    * Low quality evidence, see methodology. Broader limitations to study quality for this topic are discussed
      [here](#important-note-on-study-quality-applicable-to-some-other-sections-too). 
      Still significant and helpful findings regardless.
* [De Vries et al. 14](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25201798/)
    * Longitudinal study on the **effectiveness of puberty suppression, hormones, and later sex reassignment surgery** 
      on trans individuals in improving mental outcomes.
    * 55 trans youth (22 transfem and 33 transmasc) were followed over an 8-year period from before starting blockers 
      (mean aged 13.6 years).
    * While many studies like this compare those after treatment to those before treatment, this study also made 
      **comparisons to the general population **and still found that psychological function was on par or better.
    * _"After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the GD was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily 
      improved. Wellbeing **was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population**."_
* [Turban et al 22](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0261039)
    * Transgender people who accessed GAH during early or late adolescence had a lower odds of past-month suicidal 
      ideation and past-month severe psychological distress in adulthood, when compared to those who desired but did 
      not access GAH.
    * The results also provide additional evidence to suggest that legislation restricting transgender adolescents' 
      access to gender-affirming medical care would result in adverse mental health outcomes.
* [The Endocrine Society 15](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php)
    * "_A new study has confirmed that** transgender youth often have mental health problems** and that their 
      depression and anxiety **improve greatly with recognition** **and treatment of gender dysphoria**_."
* [Nobili 18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6223813/)
    * Longitudinal meta-analysis which indicates **transgender people** have a** lower quality of life** than the 
      general population.
    * However, that quality of life **rises dramatically** with '**Gender Affirming Treatment**', the nature of which 
      is detailed extensively in-text.
* [Cornell University](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/)
    * Large literature compilation on transgender people and the effect gender transition has on their mental health.
    * **Of 55 studies, Cornell said that 51 **indicated transitioning has a** positive effect** on the mental health of
      transgender people and **4** indicated it had** mixed or no results**. **ZERO** studies indicated gender 
      transitioning has **negative results**.
    * **USE THIS SOURCE SPARINGLY:** [parts of the study categorization and compilation methodology are very sus](https://medium.com/@JLCederblom/what-we-know-about-what-we-know-de5bdf2955dd). 
      For example, a study with some positive and some negative results could be judged by Cornell as having positive 
      results, misrepresenting the overall pool of evidence. Issues like these make Cornell's analysis much less 
      trustworthy. In general, this Cornell source has been 
      [extensively criticized](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2019/04/51524/) by others.
    * The majority of studies on the subject [involve very small sample sizes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_Pe_pzFVw3U8Uom3SKJG-__mHuYJsXeR7-lohuF9-M/edit) 
      which somewhat undermines their reliability. This is to be expected for the field though, due to the small size 
      of the trans population (small populations are harder to get large samples of), so that's ultimately to be 
      expected.
* [https://hqlo.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12955-020-01510-0](https://hqlo.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12955-020-01510-0)
* [Almazan & Keuroghlian 2021](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/2779429)
    * Study that **uses data from the US Transgender Survey (massive survey of 27,000+ people)** and does a covariate 
      analysis to learn about the **association between medical transition and several mental health indicators**.
    * Accounted for various demographic indicators including wealth (a neat finding about wealth was that those with 
      wealth also tend to have better access to gender-affirming care, and thus were more able to benefit from that 
      care).
    * Finds that "**_TGD people with a history of gender-affirming surgery had significantly lower odds of past-month
      psychological distress, past-year tobacco smoking, and past-year suicidal ideation compared with TGD people with no
      history of gender-affirming surgery_**".
          * Deeper in the study they reaffirm that **its conclusions support gender-affirmative care**, in line with 
            past smaller-scale studies. "_The association observed between gender-affirming surgeries and reduction in 
            substance use behaviors is consistent with previous studies involving small community samples that 
            demonstrated associations between gender-affirming medical care and lower odds of high-risk substance use._" 
            **and** "_This investigation offers evidence to support the clinical practice of gender-affirming surgery._"
      * Some clear limitations e.g. association doesn't necessarily mean causation. This study is included in the list 
        mainly due to the large sample it's able to pull from. Use it with this in mind.
      
### Long-term Follow-ups:

* [Weyers et al. 09](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)32422-X/fulltext)
    * **50 MtF trans people** who had done SRS **6 months earlier**
    * In **long-term follow-ups**, trans women "**_function well on a physical, emotional, psychological and 
      social level_**"
    * However, they have problems when it comes to arousal, lubrication, and pain - a minor trade-off for the 
      previously mentioned well-being measures
* [Ruppin & Pfäfflin 15](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-014-0453-5)
    * **71 trans people** (35 MtF and 36 FtM) in follow-ups ranging from **10-24 years (mean: 13.8 years)**
    * Trans people **reported being just fine in long-term follow-up**, as well as having reduced gender dysphoria
* [Johansson et al. 10](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-009-9551-1)
    * **60 trans people** in Sweden in **5 year follow-ups**
    * **No one** regretted SRS or being trans
* [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-014-0300-8](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-014-0300-8)
    * Might be 50 years but need to check
    * "_A total of 15 individuals (5 FM and 10 MF) out of 681 who received a new legal gender between 1960 and 2010 
      applied for reversal to the original sex (regret applications). This corresponds to a regret rate of 2.2 % for 
      both sexes (2.0 % FM and 2.3 % MF)_"
* [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9031580/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9031580/) follow-up for each participant
  happened 'no less than 1 year' after surgery
* [https://www.inverse.com/article/59830-gender-incongruence-transgender-surgey-survey](https://www.inverse.com/article/59830-gender-incongruence-transgender-surgey-survey) 

_For info on the commonly misused [Sweden study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21364939), 
see [this section](#specific-studies-and-articles)._

### Important note on study quality (applicable to some other sections too):

For some research topics like medical transition, it's very hard to get gold-standard study designs for a number of 
practical and ethical reasons. I'll be pulling relevant info from 
[this blog post](http://www.cakeworld.info/news/2014-08-02acommentaryonthe2004arifstudyandtheguardianarticlesexchangesarenoteffectivesayresearchers) 
which largely focuses on a different topic yet has some good info for this. In this segment it talks about how having 
[blinded studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment) and 
[control groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_and_control_groups) (two ways to improve a study's quality) 
is next to impossible for researchers to do here:

* "_One problem with medical treatment (and obviously surgery) for transsexuals is that **blinding of studies is not 
  possible**. It is immediately obvious whether a participant received treatment or not, substitution by placebo will 
  not work for obvious reasons. Clearly, all sex reassignment studies thus fail the gold standard._"
* "**_The next issue is including a control group into the study. This would require to properly diagnose transsexuals, 
  making sure they meet the requirements and indications for sex reassignment surgery, and then to randomly split the 
  participants into two groups – one receiving surgery and one not... In reality, you would find the pressure 
  transsexuals find themselves under grow so much that a large part of the untreated group commits suicide (Haas, 
  Rodgers, Herman 2014) or seeks treatment illegally or abroad. This makes such a study highly unethical, it would 
  never get the okay from an approvals body!_**"

So that leaves us with a much more limited set of options for how we can measure the outcomes of medical transition. 
These measures, while typically giving us lower quality results, are at least possible to conduct and studies have 
indeed been conducted with them. The blog lists a few of these options:

* _measure the quality of life of participants before and after sex reassignment surgery (long-term study)_
* _measure the quality of life of participants after surgery and compare them to the average quality of life of 
  transsexuals before surgery (demographics etc. need to be similar)_
* _simply ask transsexuals after surgery whether they feel better (yes, it is that easy!)_

Another issue is that as **we are dealing with a small population here** (trans people make up under 1% of the US 
population, according to nearly all estimates) and certain subsets of this population, e.g. trans people who haven't 
had medical transition or are currently going through it, are particularly hard to reach out to. This is especially 
true for specific topics like trans people in sports (miniscule number of trans athletes) and in the military, for 
example. This problem of a small population is usually bridged via 
[convenience sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_sampling) and in general by 
[recruiting small samples rather than going through the extra effort to get a large sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination), 
**but this also means that our samples are less useful overall**. These sample issues can hopefully be avoided more in 
the future as more attention and funding goes towards studying trans issues.

We should absolutely keep an eye out for newer, higher quality research as it comes out. In the meantime, we ought to 
work with the existing research and acknowledge the limitations that come with it.

## Social Transition

**Social transition improves depression, anxiety, and psychological function**

* [Journal of Adolescent Health: Connolly et al. 16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X1630146X)
    * Analyzes consensus on the effectiveness of **social transition**.
    * _"Gender-affirming medical therapy and supported social transition in childhood have been shown to correlate with 
      **improved psychological functioning** for gender-variant children and adolescents."_
* [Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: Durwood et al. 17](https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext)
    * **Children who socially transition** report levels of depression and anxiety which **closely match** levels 
      reported by **cisgender children**, indicating social transition massively decreases the risk factor of both.

---

## Puberty Blockers

**Puberty blockers are safe, well-studied, completely reversible, endorsed by credible medical and endocrinological 
associations, and effective at reducing dysphoria, anxiety, and depression.**

* [Public Broadcasting Service News: Korry 16](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/puberty-blockers-may-improve-mental-health-transgender-adolescents)
    * **Everything you need to know about puberty blockers.**
    * Full-blown puberty is irreversible.
    * Taking a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, secretion of the sex hormones can be stopped and the 
      onset of puberty suppressed, so that the body does not develop secondary sex characteristics.
    * This has been **done safely for decades** to suppress sex hormones in children who develop too early, a condition 
      known as precocious puberty.** Suppressors have also been used to treat endometriosis, uterine fibroids and 
      prostate cancer.**
    * It was only in 2008 that the **Endocrine Society approved **puberty suppressors as a treatment for transgender 
      adolescents **as young as 12 years old**. The Society, with members in more than 100 countries, has since declared 
      that the intervention appears to be **safe and effective**.  In 2011 the World Professional Association for 
      Transgender Health (WPATH), also issued Standards of Care for the treatment of patients with gender dysphoria, 
      **which include puberty suppression.**
* [Human Rights Campaign et al. 16](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf)
    * **BIG** report on trans youth and transition.
    * Endorsed by the **American Academy of Pediatrics** & the **American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians** which 
      affirms the validity of **transgender youth**, encourages **appropriate care and respect** for their transness and 
      provides resources on how to do so.
    * Outlines TYPES OF TRANSITION: hormone blockers are the **ONLY** treatment used on adolescents and are 
      **COMPLETELY reversible**.

## Common Puberty Blocker Myths

Mostly taken from [here](https://www.gendergp.com/debunking-the-myths-surrounding-puberty-blockers-trans-kids/)

1. **CLAIM: "Blockers are harmful to bone density"**

[The Endocrine Society](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-06/tes-mii061513.php) found that medical 
intervention in transgender adolescents appears to be **safe and effective** and that hormone treatment to halt puberty 
in adolescents with gender identity disorder **does not cause lasting harm** to their bones.

Some meta-studies which show bone density and bone mineral density aren't harmed:

* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469959/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469959/)
* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6616494/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6616494/)

2. **CLAIM: "Young people wouldn't want to take puberty blockers if they knew the risks"**

[Vrouenraets et al. 16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987409/) found that the few negative effects of 
puberty blockers do not change children's minds and most adolescents stated that the lack of long-term data did not and
would not stop them from wanting puberty suppression. They said that being happy in life was more important for them 
than any possible negative long-term consequence of puberty suppression.

3. **CLAIM: "Puberty blockers will give trans kids osteoporosis and make them sterile"**

[Heger et al. 99](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/84/12/4583/2864749) found that long term puberty blocker 
treatment of precocious puberty girls preserved genetic height potential and improved FH significantly combined with 
normal body proportions. No negative effect on bone mineral density and reproductive function was seen.

4. **CLAIM: "Children are too young to know they are trans and are pushed to take blockers by parents / social media / peer pressure"**

There are multiple accounts by parents and older trans people who observe that they/their child knew that they were 
transgender from a young age – [Here is one such account](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90273278) 
and [another article explaining how transgender kids aren't rushed into transitioning](https://www.thedailybeast.com/its-absurd-to-claim-that-trans-kids-are-being-rushed-into-transitioning). 
These kids [seem to have a strong identity at a young age](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/49/24480).

5. **CLAIM: "It is not ethical to give puberty blockers to transgender children"**

Focusing strictly on the ethicality of puberty blockers, [Giordano argues](https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.2007.021097) 
that the general improved quality of life, including substantially reduced risk of suicide, outweighs the ethical 
considerations of disrupting puberty. Puberty blockers can be used to relieve stress from a patient and give them more 
time to get an accurate diagnosis of the situation, 
[as was the case here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs007870050073) - certainly more ethical to go forward 
with an accurate diagnosis than without one.

6. **CLAIM: "The neutral decision is to not let minors access puberty blockers"**
* [PHSA](http://www.phsa.ca/transcarebc/child-youth/affirmation-transition/medical-affirmation-transition/puberty-blockers-for-youth): 
  Withholding puberty blockers and hormone therapy is not a neutral option and can result in an increased risk of mental health issues.
* [WPATH](https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/SOC%20v7/SOC%20V7_English2012.pdf): 
  Withholding puberty suppression and subsequent feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy is not a neutral option for 
  adolescents. 
* [ASOCTG](https://www.rch.org.au/uploadedFiles/Main/Content/adolescent-medicine/australian-standards-of-care-and-treatment-guidelines-for-trans-and-gender-diverse-children-and-adolescents.pdf): 
  Withholding of gender-affirming treatment is not considered the neutral option, and may exacerbate distress in a 
  number of ways including increasing depression, anxiety and suicidality, social withdrawal, as well as possibly 
  increasing chances of young people illegally accessing medications.
* The [scottish gov](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/foi-eir-release/2020/01/foi-201900010673/documents/foi-201900010673---document-3---puberty-blockers-and-trans-yp---april-2017/foi-201900010673---document-3---puberty-blockers-and-trans-yp---april-2017/govscot%3Adocument/FOI-201900010673%2B-%2BDocument%2B3%2B-%2B%2BPuberty%2Bblockers%2Band%2BTrans%2BYP%2B-%2BApril%2B2017.pdf)
  say it's not the neutral option "Withholding puberty blockers and hormone therapy is not a neutral option and can 
  result in an increased risk of mental health issues."

## Case Studies:

These case studies only focus on one person at a time. While they don't have the statistical validity that a study 
would have at a larger sample size, it can give us qualitative insight into how these people experience what they go 
through.

* [Kettenis et al. 11](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10508-011-9758-9.pdf)
    * Dutch trans man who started on puberty blockers at age 13 in 1988. His health and well-being was monitored 
      regularly for over 22 years.
    * He was well-functioning with no clinical signs of a negative impact of earlier puberty suppression on brain 
      development, metabolic and endocrine parameters, or bone mineral density.
* [Cohen-Kettenis 98](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9879847/)
    * Focuses on **one person's case** in which puberty blockers were used at a young age to relieve pressure from them, 
      give them more time to go through proper psychotherapy, and get a more reliable diagnosis of the situation.
    * Demonstrates that **puberty blockers can be used to more to help more accurately diagnose gender dysphoria**.
    * This should make puberty blockers an appealing option even to people who accept the science around being 
      transgender but still believe that it's mostly a trend.

## Prevalence of Discrimination

**Discrimination against trans people is a real thing and is pervasive in many aspects of society. It's not something 
that we can simply ignore when talking about trans people.**

* [European Union LGBT Survey 13](https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/eu-lgbt-survey-results-at-a-glance_en.pdf)
    * LGBT folks' self-reported perceptions of discrimination
    * Regarding trans people, finds **high levels of perceived discrimination across the board**, including:
        * **46%** felt discriminated against or harassed within the past year for being trans
        * **29%** felt discriminated against when it came to looking for employment
        * **70%** hid being trans during schooling before becoming 18 years old
        * **55%** had an incident of violence within the past year in part or whole because of them being trans
* [Wittle et al. 07](http://www.pfc.org.uk/pdf/EngenderedPenalties.pdf) ([second link](https://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/trans_country_report_-_engenderedpenalties.pdf))
    * Uses data from **872 respondents** in the UK, which is a large number of respondents compared to most studies on 
      trans people (pg 26).
        * At the time, the most **comprehensive study** on discrimination of trans people (pg 17)
    * There are a number of 'trigger points' at which trans people start being discriminated against during their
      transition, the most common of which is once they come out at work (pg 25-6).
    * Aside from that, there's a wide variety of ways and places in which trans people are discriminated against.
* [Trans Employee Experiences Survey by TotalJobs 2016](https://www.totaljobs.com/advice/wp-content/uploads/Transgender-employee-experiences-survey-report-2016_Totaljobs.pdf)
    * **Survey of 432 transgender people living in the UK and Ireland, focused on their experiences of discrimination 
      in the workplace**. Methodology made it so that the people who were surveyed had transitioned specifically while 
      working/actively seeking work.
    * Quantitative survey results came alongside qualitative ‘further comments' by some respondents to better explain 
      their experiences.
    * General trend in play in which **most transgender employees received some support and acceptance, though with a 
      substantial minority experiencing discrimination**.
    * Most discrimination tended to come from fellow employees and customers, not so much management.

## Impact of Discrimination

**Suicidality is heavily influenced by bullying, discrimination, and poor treatment. Suicide attempt rates are also far 
higher among individuals who experience substantial discrimination or harassment. 
[The ~40% suicide attempt statistic is often misrepresented](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hL53EbFmjWGeJMYuiN5msDjfjRY35q2K6vi91r0lVjY/edit).**

### Let's talk about the ~40% suicide statistic first.

What exactly is it referring to?

* **This number usually originates from the [National Transgender Discrimination Survey](https://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/resources/NTDS_Report.pdf)**, 
  which found that 41% of respondents had attempted suicide at some point in their lives. **The 41% statistic is one of 
  a range of estimates**. Some people will cite 41%, others 40%, others 50%. Different surveys and studies have gotten 
  different results, [with one review of 21 studies giving back a range between 32% and 50%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5178031/).
* **This statistic is exclusive to trans people, not the LGBT community at large**. The LGB population doesn't suffer as 
  much as the transgender population for a number of reasons, e.g. different levels of social acceptance and the 
  additional healthcare burdens that trans people deal with.
* **The statistic refers specifically to suicide _attempts_, not completed suicides**. This is important because very 
  few suicide attempts actually result in a death. Estimates for the general population say that 
  [every 25 attempts results in 1 successful death, and every year around 285,000 people become new survivors of suicide](https://save.org/about-suicide/suicide-facts/). 
  This means that anyone who conflates the 40% attempts statistic with deaths is accidentally inflating the suicide rate 
  by 25x.

So how do people misuse it?

* Some people will argue that the high suicide attempt rate means that being LGBT is unhealthy by its very nature, so we
  should discourage people from being transgender. **This 'discourage transness' argument is contradicted by the very 
  same surveys that found these high attempt rates**, as shown in some of the below source annotations (tldr the same 
  surveys that found 40% also found these numbers were higher for people who experienced more victimization, showing 
  that affirmation rather than discrimination would be more helpful for these people). The 'discourage transness' 
  argument also fails at a practical level insofar as curative therapy hasn't shown itself to be effective yet, often 
  causing more harm than good. [This other section](#impact-of-socialfamilial-support) and 
  [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hL53EbFmjWGeJMYuiN5msDjfjRY35q2K6vi91r0lVjY/edit) goes an extra step 
  to show how affirmation, not discouragement, lowers suicide attempt rates.
* Sometimes the argument made is that the high suicide attempt rate proves that transition doesn't work. However, **the 
  statistic refers specifically to lifetime suicide attempts**, which means that it's possible most of those suicide 
  attempts could have happened in life **before any transition took place**. If we saw a large number of suicide 
  attempts before transition but much fewer after transition, that would directly contradict the argument being made. 
  Of course, the argument also ignores the fact that transition isn't the only thing that impacts.
* Some people go an extra step and compare trans suicide attempt rates to other oppressed groups, e.g. black people 
  under slavery and jews during the Holocaust. That's addressed 
  [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ioc8pLo2uQ).

An extra bit on calculating _successful_ suicide rates:

* **Getting data on suicide _attempts_ is much easier to do than getting data on _successful suicides_**. This is for a 
  number of reasons:
    * People who attempted but didn't succeed with a suicide are still alive and thus can be surveyed, so you can reach 
      out to these people and ask about past suicide attempts. You can't survey people who are dead from suicide.
    * Long-term follow-ups are crucial to understanding successful suicide rates, but long-term follow-ups in general 
      have been harder to come across in the literature on transgender issues, and conducting long-term follow-ups for 
      this population has proven difficult. However, you only need a one-time survey to learn about suicide attempts 
      from people who are still alive.
    * It's next to impossible to gather data on people who believed they were trans but committed suicide before coming 
      out to anyone, let alone coming out to a researcher.
    * Sometimes transgender people commit suicide but due to a lack of an easily-identifiable paper trail on them being 
      transgender (e.g. legal documents weren't changed to reflect their transgender identity), it's harder for 
      researchers to identify trans people who committed suicide.
* Nevertheless, **some work has been done to get a better idea of the successful suicide rate**. 
  [This study published in 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7317390/) followed 8,263 transgender 
  people and **ended up with a suicide rate of 0.6%** (buried in the study though, see 
  [table 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7317390/table/acps13164-tbl-0001/)). This is obviously a far 
  cry from 40% but is still around 4x higher than the suicide rate of the general Dutch population (study looked at 
  people who went to an Amsterdam clinic).

      **97.7 percent** of those who had experienced four discriminatory or violence experiences in the past year (being 
      fired or forced to resign from a job, eviction, experiencing homelessness, and physical attack) reported seriously 
      thinking about suicide in the past year and 51.2 percent made a suicide attempt in the past year.

## Impact of Social/Familial Support

**Family support decreases suicide attempts and drug usage while improving the mental health of trans people.**

* [American Academy of Pediatrics: Olson et al. 16](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/3/e20153223) 
  ([cited](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/26/crucial-study-transgender-children-mental-health-family-support))
    * Socially transitioned transgender children who are supported in their gender identity have:
        * **Normative **levels of **depression**
        * **Minimal **elevations in **anxiety**
        * **Lower rates** of **internalizing psychopathology** (a spectrum of conditions characterized by negative 
          emotion)** **then non-socially transitioned people
* [Trujillo et al. 17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5996383/)
    * Helping trans individuals cope with harassment and rejection, particularly by drawing on social support, may 
      **promote better mental health**, which could help **reduce suicidality** in this population.
* [Cornell University](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-acceptancerejection-of-lgbt-youth-2/)
    * A literature compilation of the findings** **of **42 peer-reviewed studies** that analyzed the links between 
      family support and the health and well-being of LGBT youth
        * **25 studies **found that accepting behavior by parents toward their children's sexual orientation or gender 
          identity is linked to the health and well-being of LGBT youth.
        * The other **17 studies** found that family support in general (i.e. not necessarily in response to children's 
          sexual orientation or gender identity) is linked to the health and well-being of LGBT youth.
    * This compilation might suffer from similar problems as the Cornell link in the 
      [Medical Transition](#medical-transition) section. Things to consider.
* [Trans PULSE (subsidiary of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research)](http://transpulseproject.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Impacts-of-Strong-Parental-Support-for-Trans-Youth-vFINAL.pdf)
    * From Ontario (not international scope) but academically credible and **VERY** widely cited
    * Analysis of the ways in which **parental support** affect elements of disadvantage experienced by **transgender 
      youth.**
    * **Strong parental support** **decreases the likelihood** of a **suicide attempt** within the past year from 57% 
      to **just 4%**.
* [Bauer et al. 15](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2)
    * Data from trans people age 16+ in Ontario, Canada, including 380 who reported on suicide outcomes.
    * _"Interventions to increase **social inclusion** and **access to medical transition**, and to **reduce 
      transphobia**, have the potential to contribute to** substantial reductions** in the extremely high prevalences of 
      **suicide ideation** and attempts within trans populations"_
    * Shows every step of transitioning from changing legal documents to surgeries lowers suicide risk more.
* [Başar et al. 16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1743609516301734)
    * "Social support from family was associated with better QoL in psychological QoL, whereas perceived support from 
      friends significantly predicted all other domains of QoL"
    * "strategies to improve and strengthen friend and family support for individuals with GD should be explored by 
      clinicians"
    * "Social support and discrimination were found to have opposing contributions to QoL"
    * N = 94, median age = 26

## Chosen Name/Pronoun Usage

**The use of trans people's chosen name decreases suicide ideation, severe depression, and suicide attempts**

* [Journal of Adolescent Health: Russell ST, et al. 18](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(18)30085-5/fulltext#intraref0010a) [(cited)](https://www.healio.com/psychiatry/sexuality/news/online/%7B4a590883-1cf9-41d2-83d6-d222e613dbfa%7D/risk-for-depression-suicide-drops-when-transgender-youth-use-chosen-names)
    * Compared to those without chosen name usage, trans people with chosen name usage experienced:
        * **71% drop in severe depression**
        * **34% drop suicidal ideation**
        * **65% drop in suicide attempts**
    * Keep in mind that as of 2020, this is the only study available on chosen name usage specifically.

### Some additional notes:

* If someone were to adopt children, there's no biological basis for calling them that kid's parent, because they're 
  not biologically related. However, there is a social reason and a legal reason to call them that kid's parent -- 
  functionally, they serve the same purpose as any other parent would, so it makes much more sense to call them parents 
  than it does to call them glorified child buyers. Similarly, it doesn't make sense to use he/him pronouns on a trans 
  woman, nor vice versa. If the trans person identifies and passes as being a certain gender, they ought to be treated
  with the respective pronouns. In most contexts, the 'trans-cis' distinction will be about as relevant as the 
  biological-adopted distinction with parents.
* "You don't have to call someone by their preferred pronouns." Yeah, and you don't have to flush your poop down the 
  toilet after shitting in a public restroom, but it's a respectful thing to do.

## Bathroom Bills

**Evidence for the public safety argument in regard to bathroom bills is unsubstantiated in data. Bathroom bills would 
give rise to other problems which proponents leave unaddressed as well. Also, check out 
[this resource](https://dynalist.io/d/VuwRennroubDzZWlQrNI-hqO) for additional material on the subject.**

* [Hasenbush et al. 19](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13178-018-0335-z)
    * **Analysis of crime & privacy violations** in Massachusetts as they relate to concerns raised by those who
      advocate for '**trans bathroom bills**'.
    * Analysis indicates there is **no empirical evidence to support these concerns**; such crimes & privacy violations 
      are **exceedingly rare**.
    * Calls for trans bathroom bills are **fearmongering**, plain and simple.
    * To add additional context in the case of Massachusetts, [a different study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26219197/) 
      sampled 452 transgender people in Massachusetts and found that 65% of respondents experienced 
      discrimination/harassment in public accommodations, part of which includes discrimination in bathrooms. This is in 
      spite of the limited anti-discrimination laws that exist in the state. This would suggest that **in Massachusetts, 
      it would be more productive to focus on transgender discrimination than it would be to block them from certain 
      restrooms**.
* [Bianco 15](https://www.mic.com/articles/114066/statistics-show-exactly-how-many-times-trans-people-have-attacked-you-in-bathrooms)
    * **Zero reported cases of transgender people harassing cisgender people** in the bathroom, according to multiple

      that bathroom bills are unsubstantiated** and driven by fearmongering
    * Suggests that [bathroom bills perpetuate violence against transgender people](https://web.archive.org/web/20180415202721/https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf)

* [British Social Attitudes: Swales & Attar Taylor 17](https://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-34/moral-issues.aspx)
    * Regardless of baseless fearmongering, **most people in the UK are fine with transitioned transgenders using the 
      restroom of their gender** -_ _"_Women tend to be more comfortable with this than men, with 72% of women saying 
      they are "very" or "quite comfortable" with a transgender woman using a female toilet, compared with 64% of men 
      saying they are comfortable with a transgender man using male toilets. Around 1 in 6 (14% of women, and 15% of 
      men) say they are not comfortable with this._" (pg 14).
    * This one excludes the "Neither comfortable nor uncomfortable" answer which was another 14% from the 2017 survey.

## Specific Debunks:

Keep in mind that singular incidents don't actually prove a broader statistical trend, nor do small compilations of 
incidents.

* **[Colorado high school incident](https://archive.is/hIE44)** - claimed that a trans woman was harassing other girls 
  in a high school bathroom
    * [Debunk](https://thinkprogress.org/anti-lgbt-group-admits-it-invented-story-about-transgender-student-harassing-classmates-updated-d66f40c01517/) - 
      an interview with the school's superintendent confirms that this never happened
* **[Joey Salads experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHt7EBCgJnI)** - Salads dresses up how he thinks a trans 
  woman would, and goes into a women's restroom, receiving negative responses from others in the scene
    * [[Video] Debunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxoXcQbrGQs) - Salads misrepresented the behaviour of trans 
      women and used a single-person restroom, so his whole experiment was probably staged. A replication of the 
      experiment got no negative responses from others in the scene
* **[Dallas incident](https://www.krbcnews.com/dallas-transgender-woman-caught-taking-pictures-of-underage-girls-at-target/)** - 
  Trans woman allegedly taking photos of children in women's restrooms
    * [Debunk](https://www.krbcnews.com/about/) - the website's about page says "_And here we are today, to bring you 
      nothing but pure horse shit... This should go without saying, but everything on this website is purely for 
      entertainment purposes. We are in no way affiliated, or trying to look like we are affiliated with any local news
      station._"
* **[Casper, Wyoming incident](https://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/crime-and-courts/trial-begins-for-casper-resident-charged-with-sexually-assaulting-/article_24fd9634-02a9-5ffa-99b0-a06b4aaff15a.html)** - Trans woman, Michelle Martinez, sexually molested 10 yr-old
    * [This actually did happen](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/miguel-martinez-transgender-bathroom-controversy/), 
      but this one incident can't be extrapolated onto the greater trans population, especially not with the existing 
      empirical evidence regarding bathroom bills.
    * This one also happened in a private restroom in someone's home, so that wouldn't have been covered by a 
      restrictive bathroom bill anyway.
* **[Family Research Council compilation](https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF16F27.pdf)** - cites 25 instances of men going 
  into female bathrooms
    * Most, if not all, of the stories they cite do NOT involve or even MENTION trans people; this is by-and-large a 
      compilation of CIS men harassing women.
        * While the FRC argues that the problem itself is in fact cis men exploiting a perceived loophole, most of their 
          "examples" lack any connection to bathroom bills regardless. 
    * Even if every single incident involved a trans person, this does barely anything to justify bathroom bills. 25 
      instances over the course of 18 years (1999-2017) is barely anything demonstrative of a larger problem in need of 
      being addressed at a large scale.
    * Most, if not all, of those incidents would be illegal even without a restrictive trans bathroom bill being in 
      effect, so introducing such a law isn't really the solution here.
    * Gathering this sort of data via media reports is rather dubious too, considering some of these incidents go 
      unreported and some of those which are reported turn out to be hoaxes. It doesn't help that a good few
      hyper-partisan and anti-trans advocacy groups are cited, like DailyWire and MassResistance, which both have 
      interest in spreading anti-trans info even if it turns out to be misleading or falsified.
* "_[When is 90% not Substantially ALL?](https://outofmypantiesnow.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/when-is-90-not-substantially-all/)_" 
  TERF WordPress blog
    * Ignoring the preamble, the post is very obviously a gish gallop which has lots of dead links and an awful lot of 
      links unrelated to the transgender bathroom stuff. The compilation also includes way more than just transgender 
      people, extending its focus to cross-dressers (that is, anyone who is wearing literally any clothing which we 
      associate with the opposite gender, such as [a naked man who is wearing nothing but women's heels](https://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2007Apr26/0,4675,NothingButHeels,00.html)).
    * Many of these incidents don't even give us evidence that cross-dressing is something the people involved do on a 
      regular basis, e.g. an incident where [a man impersonated a female police officer](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2012/04/police-crossdressing-robber-impersonating-cop.html). 
      We don't know if that person regularly cross-dresses or if the person was impersonating a police officer who just 
      happens to be a woman, but it gets included in the blog's list anyway.
    * The blog even includes incidents where no crime was committed, e.g. 
      [a man who drowned because the skirt he was wearing was too tight to let him swim](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/crossdresser-killed-by-skirt-18076161). 
      How is this an example of a transgender sex crime in a bathroom??
    
### Other Notes:

* If a man wanted to pretend to be trans as an excuse to rape women, he doesn't have to fake being a woman to go into 
  the bathroom. The law won't physically prevent him from going in there.
* Rape, sexual harassment, and voyeurism are already illegal, so if your primary concern is women being sexually 
  harassed or raped by men in the bathroom, then there's already laws to address your concerns.
* [Even from a conservative perspective](https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/12/transgender-bathrooms-conservative-defense-transgender-rights/), 
  bathroom bills give an unnecessary amount of power to big government and aren't necessarily effective. It's not 
  practical for the government to enforce a trans-oriented policy like this because most trans people don't look like 
  their birth sex. The cis man won't present as a woman, just as a trans man wouldn't present as a woman. That would 
  [make it look like a girl is going into the men's restroom](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-transgender-tweet_n_56f3f787e4b04c4c3761652b), 
  or vice versa - [memes like this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/584810436801593433/890247143405813780/229225625_10223771452107032_6267901065728286146_n.png) 
  and [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/584810436801593433/892821491027148850/nrdis4wbrT34NY8QCe6-fUjNl1YmTbeEw03c7ikLm7rlpVhts3s1T3YaPRzO7JUQcKmO-FlkGmAVkwOYMcn6plKXOWhzp0hW2NNi.png) 
  carry home the point.
* The burden of proof that transphobes for stuff like this can easily be turned against them. Someone could find several
  instances of cis people harassing trans people in bathrooms 
  ([which is far more common anyway](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-survey-idUSKBN13X0BK)) but that doesn't 
  justify banning cis people from their respective bathrooms.
* You don't want to ask "find me one instance of a bathroom assault", as you can find one instance of all sorts of 
  unusual things. It's instead better to ask "show me (MISSING TEXT?)

## Prisons

* [Just Detention International Organization 13](https://justdetention.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FS-Targets-For-Abuse-Transgender-Inmates-And-Prisoner-Rape.pdf)
    * **59 percent** of transgender women housed in men's prisons had been **sexually abused** while incarcerated, as 
      compared to 4 percent of non-transgender inmates in men's prisons.

    * ""Based on this exercise, there were 0.8 transgender prisoners reported per 1,000 prisoners in custody.
    * That translates to around 1/1250 prison inmates being trans, and 0.08% is well below the typical 0.6% general 
      population estimate for transgender people.

## Public Perception and Depiction 

**In media, trans and LGBT people are generally depicted either negatively or in shallow, stereotypical ways. Polling 
usually shows a substantial minority who oppose trans-affirming policies, though fortunately most Americans are fine 
with trans people.**

* [Colorado State University: Matthews 16](https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/10217/178827/Matthews_colostate_0053N_13859.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
    * Interesting (and long) qualitative analysis on the **depiction of transgender people in _Sports Illustrated_** 
      over past decades.
    * Finds disproportionately **negative depictions** (of course).
* [McInroy 16](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13676261.2016.1184243)
    * Finds that LGBT folk are usually depicted in media in stereotypical ways, which could limit their perception of 
      their possible future
* [Hughto et al. 20](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/lgbt.2020.0279)
    * Frequent exposure to negative depictions of transgender people in the media was significantly associated with 
      clinical symptoms of depression, anxiety, global psychological distress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      in this population
    * Those who reported greater frequency of exposure to these messages were significantly more likely to exhibit 
      clinical symptoms of depression, anxiety, global psychological distress, and PTSD. The association held even after 
      adjustments were made for variables such as age, race, income, and reported experiences of childhood and/or adult 
      sexual or physical abuse, which suggests that negative media messages may have an independent impact on the mental 
      health of transgender populations exposed to such messages.
* [UCLA Williams Institute: Luhur, Brown, & Flores 17](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Public-Opinion-Trans-US-Aug-2019.pdf)
    * While a majority of Americans agree on giving a number of rights to trans people, there is still a substantial 
      minority who oppose such.

## Trans Athletes

**Trans athletes are at no significant advantage in athletics, especially since hormones reverse any strength 
discrepancies, yet face substantial discrimination in athletics. Keep in mind that specific instances of trans people 
winning sports competitions doesn't actually prove anything about broader trends. Also worth noting the low quality of
much of this research because there's very few trans athletes and nobody cared about this until like 2015, which means 
we should be open to new research developments for this topic and a lot isn't settled science yet.**

* [Jones et al. 17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357259/)
    * Systemic review covering prior research on **trans individuals' performance in sports** and preexisting 
      **sports policies** concerning trans people, amounting to **8 research articles and 31 sports policies**.
    * Finds that "There is no direct or consistent research suggesting transgender female individuals (or male 
      individuals) have an athletic advantage at any stage of their transition."
        * (includes cross-sex hormones, gender-confirming surgery)
    * This particular subject is in need of more and better research because **most research is really low quality**, 
      so using this systemic review as a _definitive_ statement on the topic is a dumb thing to do. The systemic review 
      is only as good as the studies it rests on.
        * Much of the **low-quality problem comes from small sample sizes** (you can see sample sizes in 
          [this table](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357259/table/Tab1/)). **It's hard to gather a large 
          group of transgender athletes if there are so few in the first place**. To put this into broader context, we 
          are looking at a small portion of the population (trans people), within that group is a small number of 
          athletes, and within that group we have trans athletes who do competitive sports, aka the people we can 
          recruit for our sample. So we're looking at a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the population.
        * Because of the lack of good research on the subject, **anti-trans sports policies are likely based on little 
          if any empirical evidence** (very little of that evidence exists).
    * Trans individuals experience **substantial discrimination** from sports institutions due to existing anti-trans 
      policies.
    * [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-020-01324-6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-020-01324-6) 
      Richardson and Chen published a critique of this study, this links to a rebuttal of the critique.
* [National Collegiate Athletic Association: Griffin et al. 10](https://web.archive.org/web/20151222002856/https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/NCLR_TransStudentAthlete+(2).pdf)
    * "Any athletic advantages a transgender girl or woman arguably may have as a result of her prior testosterone 
      levels **dissipate after about one year** of estrogen therapy."
    * "According to medical experts on this issue, the assumption that a transgender girl or woman competing on a 
      women's team would have a competitive advantage outside the range of performance and competitive advantage or 
      disadvantage that already exists among female athletes is **not supported by evidence**."
* [National Collegiate Athletic Association: Board of Governors Statement on Transgender Participation (2021)](https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/ncaa-board-of-governors-statement-on-transgender-participation) with an associated [policy pdf](https://ncaaorg.s3.amazonaws.com/inclusion/lgbtq/INC_TransgenderHandbook.pdf)
    * Very clear **emphasis on maximizing both inclusiveness and fairness for athletes**.
    * Only restriction in place for trans people is testosterone suppression treatment for transgender women - this 
      policy is meant to preserve fairness in competition while letting trans women participate in their proper sports 
      teams.
    * **The policy pdf goes more in-depth about broader inclusion of trans athletes into sports teams**, suggesting
      'best practices' for athletics administrators, coaches, etc. That mostly just comes down to standardizing NCAA 
      practice at other schools, educating about non-discrimination laws that apply for sports, and being respectful 
      and understanding towards trans athletes (sportsmanship!).
* [University of Leicester: Hargie et al. 15](https://web.archive.org/web/20180719224455/https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/38576/6/Transgender%20paper.pdf)
    * _"It is primarily the **lack of public understanding** regarding transgender people that remains the greatest
      cause of their exclusion"_, not some perceived advantage among athletes.
    * The study found** interconnecting themes **among all its participants to substantiate the prominence of public 
      exclusion:
        * The impact of alienating** sports experiences** at school
        * The intimidating nature of the **changing room **environment
        * The fear of public space and how this drastically constrained their **ability to engage in sport** and 
          physical activity
        * The overall impact of their exclusion in terms of being denied the** social, health and well-being 
          aspects** of sport
* [Lenzi 18](https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2007&context=aulr)
    * **Legal analysis of the legality of transgender sports policy** in the context of Title IX and the 14th 
      Amendment
    * **Broad conclusion in favor of inclusive policy** for trans people, some nuance.
        * There's different types of trans-affirmative sports policies. States like Connecticut have a **fully inclusive 
          policy** that lets you participate in whatever team aligns with your gender identity. The assumption here is 
          that the very small number of transgender athletes doesn't pose a significant threat to fairness for cis 
          people. Other states like Idaho and Ohio have a **partially inclusive policy** which basically lets you 
          participate in the team of your gender identity as long as you complete a year of hormone therapy. This 
          restriction is meant to keep sports fair for everyone involved by dealing with biological advantages one 
          group might have over the other.
        * It's important to note that this conclusion is primarily drawn from legal analysis, working its way through 
          the existing law apparatus that we have in place. **This is meant to provide a solution for trans athletes 
          that is legal**, so the legal prioritization might not be best for a debate about something else, e.g. the 
          _morality_ or _impact_ of these policies.
    * Throughout the paper Lenzi emphasizes that sex-segregated sports gives cis women a fair chance at being 
      competitive against cis men, as cis men generally have a biological advantage. However, **trans people who have 
      gone through cross-gender hormone therapy are not comparable to their cis counterparts** in the same way.
        * "_Before high school athletic associations devise regulations regarding transgender athletes, they must 
          openly acknowledge the inherent biological differences between males and females. A trans girl, who has a 
          male body that regularly produces testosterone, has a physical advantage over a cis girl whose body produces 
          significantly less testosterone. **However, when a trans girl receives cross-gender hormone therapy, the 
          treatments greatly reduce any former biological edge.** Hormone treatments for MTF trans girls increase body 
          fat, decrease muscle mass, and may even cause a slight loss in height. After only one year of cross-gender 
          hormone therapy, a trans girl will have estrogen and testosterone levels similar to the average cis girl._"

    * This op-ed specifically focuses on the impact of HRT on trans people's athletic performance, but from a 
      qualitative POV - a trans woman explaining the experience she went through with HRT impacting her athletic ability
    * This qualitative focus can give us a good perspective on what these trans athletes are going through when they go 
      through HRT

### Other Notes:

**On physiological differences**: segregating sports based on something like height, testosterone, etc. can get really 
messy especially when it's tied in with the existing sex-segregation in sports. In some cases, this has led to the 
[outright exclusion of biological females from women's sports simply due to naturally high testosterone levels](https://www.axios.com/namibia-disqualified-naturally-high-testosterone-olympic-24d0f1f9-9491-47bb-8c5a-199bf91e6255.html). 
Some of these policies need to be carefully thought through so as not to accidentally exclude people who really didn't 
do anything to deserve it.

**On Fallon Fox/Tamika Brents**: For one, their specific match is pretty much just one match, one data point out of so 
many other matches and games. This one anecdote is not statistical data and is not generalizable to all trans people in
sports (though let's be real, finding any good statistical data on trans athletes is a challenge). Second, however 
shocking the concussion and broken skull were, these sorts of traumatic head injuries [are sadly very common in MMA fighting](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/mma-fighters-suffer-traumatic-brain-injury-in-almost-a-third-of-professional-bouts-study),
to the point where it's even been banned in some countries (plus banned and re-legalized in others). MMA is a relatively 
dangerous sport and Tamika Brents' injuries are unfortunately not particularly out of the ordinary for that sport, so it 
doesn't make much sense to hyperfocus on Fox being trans here.

**On general "fairness" args:** The pretty obvious rebuttal is that sex segregated sports does not somehow make 
everything fair. Some of this is more general (not all players of the same sex have the same testosterone levels) and 
some of it is specific to the sport (in basketball, taller players have an obvious advantage over shorter players). In 
the case of basketball, someone who is 6'4" in height has an obvious biological advantage over someone who is 5'4", 
however we allow these two players to compete whereas a typical cis man is barred from competing with a typical cis 
woman because of the man's biological advantages. The question then comes down to what sort of fairness we want to
promote, and for whom, as different people benefit from different approaches to fairness in sports. 
[This article](https://www.outsports.com/2019/4/11/18296976/trans-athlete-fair-sports-rules-lgbtq-fairness) covers the 
broader point fairly well.

## Neurology/Biology

**Some trans individuals neurologically reflect cisgender people of their desired gender, suggesting a neurological 
component to their experiences. This suggests that gender has some biological basis, but not necessarily that gender is 
100% biological. There's obviously a sociological basis to gender and gender roles which complement its biological 
aspects.**

* [European Society of Endocrinology 18](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180524112351.htm)
    * **Brain Scans** show that (many) transgender individuals neurologically reflect their identity, not their 
      assigned gender at birth.
        * The study included both adolescent boys and girls with gender dysphoria and used magnetic resonance imaging 
          (**MRI**) scans to assess brain activation patterns in response to a pheromone known to produce 
          **gender-specific activity**.
        * The pattern of brain activation in both transgender adolescent boys and girls more **closely resembled that 
          of non-transgender** boys and girls of their desired gender.
* [Smith et al. 15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763415002432)
    * Out of 14 studies of brain structure (total N=307, N MtF=195, N FtM=112) with a total of 23 results: 6 results 
      that trans people had brain structure similarities to their birth sex, 12 results that trans people had brain 
      structure similarities to their gender identity, and 5 results that unclear results (either no significant sex 
      differences or no significant differences between trans and cis participants, or both).
    * **12 of 18 (66%) results** with clear results **suggest trans people have brain structures with similarities to 
      their current gender identity**.
        * Keep in mind that's no consensus, but it suggests there could be something to check out there.
* [Suraswat et al. 15](https://journals.aace.com/doi/abs/10.4158/EP14351.RA)
    * Studies on gray matter, white matter, twins, and prenatal exposure all suggest -- albeit, with limited sample 
      sizes and methods -- that transgender identity, like homosexuality, has a biological origin.
    * "_Although the mechanisms remain to be determined, **there is strong support in the literature for a biologic 
      basis of gender identity**._"
    * "_Current data suggest a biologic etiology for transgender identity. Studies of DSD patients and neuroanatomical 
      studies provide the strongest evidence for the organic basis of transgender identity. **Because the sample sizes 
      of most studies on this subject were small, the conclusions must be interpreted with caution**. Further research 
      is required to assign specific biologic mechanisms for gender identity._"

## Detransition/Regret

**While detransitioning is rare in the first place, it is overwhelmingly driven by various forms of discrimination, not 
uncertainty with regard to identity. Regret rates are also very low. This seems to be true for both trans adults and 
trans kids. Credit for most of this stuff goes to 
[this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KxCxhpj1CAOr8CzWow-rUeBZig6q6n49x3MPdFXhzL8/edit?usp=drivesdk) by 
[u/Albamc35](https://www.reddit.com/user/Albamc35/), feel free to cite it for convenience.**

### Trans Kids Detransition:

* [Using information from the Australian Court](https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/FamCAFC/2017/258.html), 
  96% of all patients who were assessed and received a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria by the 5th intervenor (the Royal 
  Children's Hospital) from 2003 to 2017 continued to identify as transgender or gender diverse into late adolescence. 
  **No patient who had commenced stage 2 treatment had sought to transition back to their birth assigned sex**.
* [A summarization on all people treated in Amsterdam from 1972 up to 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29463477/), 
  which treats more than 95% of the transgender population in the Netherlands, found that out of those referred to the 
  clinic in before the age of 18 and treated with puberty blockers, **4 out of 207 trans girls (2%) stopped puberty 
  suppression** without proceeding to HRT and **2 out of 370 trans boys (less than 1%) stopped puberty suppression** 
  without proceeding to HRT.
* [A study of 143 youth receiving puberty-blocking medication in the Netherlands](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10508-020-01660-8.pdf) 
  found that 3.5% chose to discontinue puberty blockers without seeking any further transition treatment.
* [A William's Institute report](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/age-trans-individuals-us/) finds 
  that there is **no significant difference between the number of trans teens and the number of trans adults (0.7% and 
  0.6% respectively)**. The slight decrease in the older age groups could be down to rejection from peers, as 
  [older generations are much less likely to support trans rights than younger people](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Public-Opinion-Trans-US-Aug-2019.pdf). 

Also, trans kids are not 'going through a phase.' First of all, 
[an article from a magazine from the American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx)
mentions how by age 4, children have a 'stable sense of their gender identity.' And
a [study on trans and cis kids](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/49/24480) ([cited in this Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2020/12/29/study-transgender-children-recognize-their-authentic-gender-at-early-age-just-like-other-kids/#1f9d83da526b)) 
found gender identity — the concept of knowing whether one's self is male, female or non-binary — is as strong in trans 
kids as it is among those identifying as cis. Similar results are found 
[in this study](http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d642/d3853a04e464d85b629115d7ff513b9da20a.pdf). There's also a number 
of [studies which further suggest a neurological or biological component to gender identity](#neurologybiology).

### General Detransition:

* [A study on detransition rates in a national UK Gender Identity Clinic](https://epath.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Boof-of-abstracts-EPATH2019.pdf#page=139) 
  (pg 139) found **out that of the 3398 patients who had appointments during this period, 16 (0.47%) expressed 
  transition-related regret or detransitioned**. Of these 16, one patient expressed regret but was not considering 
  detransitioning, two had expressed regret and were considering detransitioning, three had detransitioned, and ten had 
  detransitioned temporarily. 
    * The reasons stated by patients for their regret or detransition included: social factors, reporting physical 
      complications, and changing their mind about their gender identity and identifying as their gender assigned at 
      birth, which shows that of that minority, alot were not due to releasing they are not trans.
* [A transgender mental health survey in the UK](https://www.gires.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/trans_mh_study.pdf) 
  (pg 66-67) found in terms of social changes that they had made in relation to being trans or transitioning, **only 9% 
  had significant regrets. In regard to the physical changes of being trans, only 2% having major regrets**. Remember 
  that regrets =/= detransition though.
* [A massive survey of trans people in the United States](https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf) 
  (pg 111) found that even including people who only temporarily detransition either socially or medical (or both), only
  8% of respondents reported having detransitioned at some point.
    * Of these "detransitioners," **only 5% did it because they realized it was not for them, accounting for a mere 
      0.4% of the overall sample**.
    * And even then, 62% of those who had detransitioned reported that they were currently living full time in a gender 
      different compared to the gender they were thought to be at birth.
    * "_The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS) is the largest survey examining the experiences of transgender people 
      in the United States, with 27,715 respondents from all fifty states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, 
      Guam, Puerto Rico, and U.S. military bases overseas_"
* [Turban et al. 19](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2749479)
    * Research on 27,715 transgender adults living in the US, 3,869 of whom had been exposed to gender identity 
      conversion efforts.
    * They found that quote "**_exposure to [gender identity conversion efforts] before age 10 years was significantly 
      associated with several measures of suicidality, including lifetime suicide attempts_**".
    * They also found no significant difference when comparing religious or secular conversion attempts. So it's not a 
      case of finding the right way to do it, there is no right way to do it.

### SRS Detransition:

* [A study on people who went through sex reassignment surgery in the Netherlands](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15842032/) 
  found that of 162 trans adults, **only 1 reported they would choose not to transition again**. Another had some 
  regrets but would choose to transition again (0.6% regret rate).
* [An analysis of all applications for sex reassignment surgery in Sweden](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24872188/) 
  found that of people undergoing SRS, **regret was about 2.2% and there was a significant decline of regret over time**.
* [In this international survey of 46 surgeons](https://journals.lww.com/prsgo/Fulltext/2018/08001/Abstract__A_Survey_Study_of_Surgeons__Experience.266.aspx) 
  (67% of providers have been in practice for greater than 10 years) they were asked to select a range representing the 
  number of transgender patients they have surgically treated, and **this amounted to a cumulative number of 
  approximately 22,725 patients treated** by the cohort. 
    * 49% of respondents had never encountered a patient who regretted their gender transition or were seeking 
      detransition care. 12 providers encountered 1 patient with regret and the rest encountered more than one patient. 
      This amounted to a total of 62 patients. There were 13 patients who regretted chest surgery and 45 patients who 
      regretted genital surgery.
    * Overall, only 22 patients (0.1% of the sample) detransitioned because of a change in gender identity.
* [A study on 232 trans women who were operated by the same surgeon 'using a consistent technique'](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364#page-1) 
  found that **none reported outright regret and only a few expressed even occasional regret**. Dissatisfaction was most 
  strongly associated with unsatisfactory physical and functional results of surgery.
* [An international study on 201 people who had trans-related surgeries](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471328/) 
  found that **postoperative satisfaction was 94% to 100%**, depending on the type of surgery performed. Only eight (6%) 
  of the participants reported dissatisfaction and/or regret.
* [A study in Belgium of 107 people who underwent SRS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1158136006000491?via%3Dihub) 
  found none of the patients regretted their surgery. 
* [A study of 218 patients in Sweden](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9570489/) found only 3.8% had regretted it. The 
  study also notes that **support from family and friends is a huge factor in reducing regret**. Keep in mind that this 
  data was taken in 1998 during a time in which being trans was less socially accepted than they are now, so that number 
  has evidently decreased over time.
* [A study on 66 patients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11564029/) found none of the present patients claimed to 
  regret their decision to undergo gender-transformation surgery.
* [A meta analysis](https://web.archive.org/web/20070812100135/http://www.symposion.com:80/ijt/pfaefflin/6002-6.htm#Treatment%20Results), 
  which looked at 74 follow-up studies and 8 reviews of outcome studies, found **over a 30-year period, only 20 MTF and 
  5 FTM regretted transitioning due to gender identity**. According to 
  [this study that mentions this](http://www.amsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CareOfThePatientUndergoingSRS.pdf), 
  there were 1000-1600 MTF and 400-550 FTM patients, which equates to regret rates of &lt;1% for FTMs and 1-1.5% for 
  MTFs (page 4).

### What about older studies?

**I will be talking about the studies on trans kids, which are the most quoted I have seen**. One recent example of 
quotation is in [JK Rowling's essay](https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/):

"_I want to be very clear here: I know transition will be a solution for some gender dysphoric people, although I'm
also aware through extensive research that studies have consistently shown that between 60-90% of gender dysphoric teens
will grow out of their dysphoria._"

But there are a number of flaws with these studies. 
[An analysis of 3 of these studies found this](https://jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(15)00794-7/fulltext) (**I'm 
quoting, and it's a long quote**):

"_The 3 largest and most-cited studies have reported on the adolescent or adult gender identities of cohorts who had, in 
childhood, showed gender "atypical" patterns of behavior. Of those who could be followed up, a minority were 
transgender: 1 of 44, 9 of 45, and 21 of 54. Most of the remaining children later identified as gay, lesbian, or 
bisexual (although a small number also was heterosexual)._

_However, close inspection of these studies suggests that **most children in these studies were not transgender to begin 
with**. In 2 studies, a large minority (40 and 25) of the children did not meet the criteria for GID to start with, 
suggesting they were not transgender (because transgender children would meet the criteria). Further, even those who 
met the GID diagnostic criteria were rarely transgender. Binary transgender children (the focus of this discussion) 
insist that they are the "opposite" sex, but most children with GID/GD do not. In fact, the DSM-III-R directly stated 
that true insistence by a boy that he is a girl occurs "rarely" even in those meeting that criterion, a point others 
have made. When directly asked what their gender is, more than 90% of children with GID in these clinics reported an 
answer that aligned with their natal sex, the clearest evidence that most did not see themselves as transgender._

_We know less about the identities of the children in the third study, but the recruitment letters specifically 
requested boys who made "statements of wanting to be a girl" (p. 12), with no mention of insisting they were girls. 
Barring evidence that the children in these studies were claiming an "opposite" gender identity in childhood, these 
studies are agnostic about the persistence of an "opposite" gender identity into adulthood. Instead, they show that most 
children who behave in gender counter-stereotypic ways in childhood are not likely to be transgender adults._"

**[This analysis of 4 of these studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15532739.2018.1456390) found 
methodological, theoretical, ethical, and interpretive concerns**. Here is their breakdown:

#### Methodological Concerns

1. The potential misclassification of child research participants
2. The lack of acknowledgement of social context for research participants
3. The age of participants at follow-up
4. The potential misclassification of adolescent and young adult participants lost to follow-up

#### Theoretical Concerns

1. Assumptions inherent in "desistance" terminology
2. Binary gender framework
3. Presumption of gender stability as a positive outcome

#### Ethical Concerns

1. Intensive treatment and testing of child participants
2. Questionable goals of treatment
3. Lack of consideration of children's autonomy

#### Interpretive Concerns

1. The assumption that unknown future adult needs should supersede known childhood needs
2. The underestimation of harm when attempting to delay or defer transition

Here are the conclusions from [this presentation from a WPATH conference](https://gidreform.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/methodological-questions-in-childhood-gender-identity-desistence-research/) 
(which is a [reputable organization on gender dysphoria](https://www.hrc.org/resources/world-professional-association-for-transgender-health-wpath)), 
which criticizes some of those studies:

1. Evidence from these studies suggests that the majority of gender-nonconforming children are not gender dysphoric 
   adolescents or adults.
3. It does not support the stereotype that most children who are actually gender dysphoric will "desist" in their gender 
   identities before adolescence.
5. These studies do acknowledge that intense anatomic dysphoria in childhood may be associated with persistent gender 
   dysphoria and persistent gender identity through adolescence.
7. Speculation that allowing childhood social transition traps cisgender youth in roles that are incongruent with their 
   identities is not supported by evidence.
9. These studies fail to examine the diagnostic value of Real Life Experience in congruent gender roles for gender 
   dysphoric children.

I'll also leave some links that you can look at about those poor studies and this topic in general for further reading

## Canada's C-16 Bill

**C-16 is about hate crimes, not pronoun usage. Misgendering doesn't cross the threshold for being a hate crime in 
Canada.**

* [The contents of the bill](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/LegislativeSummaries/421C16E): 
  "**_The bill is intended to protect individuals from discrimination within the sphere of federal jurisdiction and from
  being the targets of hate propaganda, as a consequence of their gender identity or their gender expression. The bill 
  adds "gender identity or expression" to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights 
  Act and the list of characteristics of identifiable groups protected from hate propaganda in the Criminal Code. It 
  also adds that evidence that an offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on a person's gender identity 
  or expression constitutes an aggravating circumstance for a court to consider when imposing a criminal sentence._**"
    * Essentially, **hate crimes against people based on gender identity/expression will be treated legally at the same 
      level as other hate crimes**, e.g. racially motivated hate crimes.
    * Not once are pronouns or misgendering explicitly brought up in the bill.
    * This provides some further clarity on the bill's purpose: "_The recognition of the rights of gays and lesbians has 
      evolved in some measure through the recognition of the right to be free from discrimination based on sexual 
      orientation. Sexual orientation does not necessarily protect those whose gender does not align with their sex 
      assigned at birth, or who do not consider themselves to fit in with conventional conceptions of gender. **Bill 
      C-16 seeks in part to add the grounds of gender identity and gender expression to broaden the recognition of the 
      rights of other members of sexual minority groups**._"
* [Torontoist: Cumming 16](https://torontoist.com/2016/12/are-jordan-petersons-claims-about-bill-c-16-correct/)
    * This article includes a legal expert who comments on C-16 and Jordan Peterson's takes
    * Jordan Peterson, an active critic of C-16, is likely misunderstanding or mischaracterizing the bill
    * **The threshold for a hate crime in Canada is likely too high for misgendering to be considered a hate crime**
* [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 18](https://www.cbc.ca/cbcdocspov/features/canadas-gender-identity-rights-bill-c-16-explained)
    * Good brief on what C-16 actually does
    * Bill C-16 added the words "gender identity or expression" to three places:
        * **Canadian Human Rights Act**, joining a list of identifiable groups that are protected from discrimination. 
          These groups include age, race, sex, religion, disability, etc.
        * **A section of the Criminal Code that targets hate speech** — defined as advocating genocide and the public 
          incitement of hatred — where it joins other identifiable groups.
        * **A section of the Criminal Code dealing with sentencing for hate crimes**. If there's evidence that an 
          offence is motivated by bias, prejudice or hate, it can be taken into account by the courts during sentencing.
    * **Being jailed for repeated misgendering would be very difficult to do** even with C-16 in place
    
### Specific Debunks:

* **CLAIM: [Father in British Columbia found guilty of 'family violence' for misgendering his trans son](https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/father-gagged-found-guilty-family-violence-calling-trans-daughter/)**
    * Case was unrelated to C-16 and had far more to it than misgendering.
    * The father was actively bringing his trans son's personal issues to light in public interviews, and brought up 
      personal details during those interviews.
    * The father was also actively contributing to worsening the child's mental health (the son had already attempted 
      suicide in part because of his father, for example).
    * [Original source](https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/sc/19/06/2019BCSC0604.htm) in regard to this case, provides

* **CLAIM: [Anti-gay activist William Whatcott fined $55,000 for misgendering trans activist Morgane Oger](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/anti-gay-activist-ordered-to-pay-55000-to-b-c-trans-activist-in-fight-over-hateful-flyer)**
    * Unrelated to C-16, dealt instead with section 7 of British Columbia's 
      [Human Rights Code](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/00_96210_01) (keep in mind C-16 was 
      national legislation, not provincial legislation).
    * Whatcott was spreading anti-trans misinformation in general, specifically targeting Oger who was running for 
      political office at the time and lost by a small margin.
    * [Original source](http://www.westcoastleaf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/58_Oger_v_Whatcott_No_7_2019_BCHRT_58.pdf) 
      in regard to this case, provides more context — C-16 not cited in it, aside from the _Canadian Human Rights Act_ 
      being brought up _once_ in 104 pages.

## In the Military

**Transgender people should be allowed to serve in the military. There is a notable lack of evidence for transgender 
personnel disrupting unit cohesion, and other concerns e.g. costs and deployability disruption aren't THAT big a deal.**

* ["Assessing the Implications of Allowing Transgender Personnel to Serve Openly" by RAND Corporation, 2016](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1530.html) ([full text pdf](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1500/RR1530/RAND_RR1530.pdf))
    * Study from RAND Corporation about potential impacts of transgender military service. **Covers a LOT of ground over 
      the course of NINE chapters**, including but not limited to:
        * The existing trans military population
        * Their healthcare needs
        * The impact of letting them serve openly
        * DoD policies that would need to be changed to let them serve openly
    * **ON TRANSGENDER MILITARY ESTIMATES**: RAND's estimates found there are currently 1,320–6,630 active transgender 
      members in the military. This wide range exists in part because of difficulties getting an accurate estimate.
    * **ON TRANSITION-RELATED HEALTHCARE COSTS**: The transition-related healthcare costs would be relatively low for 
      trans people, adding between $2.4m and $8.4m to overall healthcare costs for active service members. That's a 
      0.04-0.13% increase in overall costs.
        * Some people might think this is a 0.04-0.13% increase relative to the entire military budget. This is not 
          true. This is not for the overall military budget, but rather for costs specifically **related to healthcare** 
          for **active** service members.
        * It's important to note that **not all of the trans people in the military actively need funds for medical 
          transition**. In any given year, RAND found that "_Only a subset will seek gender transition–related 
          treatment... between 29 and 129 service members in the active component will seek transition-related care that 
          could disrupt their ability to deploy._"
    * **ON DEPLOYABILITY IMPACT**: Most issues with non-deployability **come around during medical transition**, mainly 
      in the form of medical leave for having and recovering from transition-related surgeries. This translates to 
      29-129 people per year getting medical service that could possibly disrupt their ability to be deployed during 
      that mid-transition time period. **RAND does recommend additional mental health screening in the specific context 
      of gender dysphoria**, at least pre-transition. Those who are post-transition are expected to be safely deployed 
      along the same parameters as other service members (for example, other members also get their mental health 
      screened prior to deployment).
    * **ON UNIT COHESION IMPACT**: Impacts on unit cohesion **weren't found to be a big concern** in the report, going 
      off of results from similar integration efforts in the past, e.g. including women and LGB people. They also took 
      a look at other countries (Australia, Canada, Israel, and the UK) that had included trans people in the military, 
      and found no significant impact on unit cohesion in those countries.
* [Okros & Scott 2014](https://www.palmcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Transgender-Military-Service-in-Canada.pdf)
    * Study that analyzed the impact of a transgender-inclusive policy on the operational effectiveness of the Canadian 
      military
    * **Used FIVE different methods to try and find any negative impacts**, e.g. interviews of military experts, people 
      with personal experience, media reports, etc
    * **Found NO evidence whatsoever that the military's operational effectiveness suffered** from the trans-inclusive 
      policy
* [Williams Institute, 2014](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-military-service-us/)
    * Study that tries to estimate the number of military servicemembers and veterans that are transgender.
    * Came out with a rather high estimate of 15,500 active servicemembers who are transgender, and around 134,300 
      transgender people who either are serving or have served in the military before. **This translates to around 20% 
      of the transgender population having served in the military at some point**.
        * For reference, **only around 10% of the general population has served in the military at some point**, active 
          and veterans included.
    * This should emphasize the importance of the discussion around trans people in the military, as so many trans 
      people have gone through it. A ban from the military could have a serious impact on the transgender community.

**Brief note on surveys that ask servicemembers how they would feel about a trans military ban: this data isn't actually 
useful**. Due to the politically charged nature of the topic, responses may not have reflected actual experiences within 
the military or whatnot, [but instead may reflect the political affiliation of respondents](https://www.palmcenter.org/blog_posts/in-polling-context-is-everything/). 
This could make this source useless as a result. This is something I saw in two studies.

* [This study](https://dworakpeck.usc.edu/sites/default/files/2020-10/Dunlap%20Holloway%20Pickering%20et%20al.pdf) set 
  out to **survey a diverse group of active duty, cisgender servicemembers** and found that overall, 66% supported 
  transgender inclusion into the military. This differed between subsets of the surveyed group. For example, 82% of LGB 
  servicemembers supported transgender service while only 57% of heterosexual ones did. While this study didn't
  explicitly ask about political leanings (e.g. right wing, liberal, etc.) **the results do fall in line a way with how 
  these demographics typically fall politically** - LGB people are more liberal and thus more opposed to the ban, 
  heterosexual people tend to be more distributed across both parties and as a result are more split half-and-half in 
  the survey results. **This would suggest that certain demographic characteristics correlate with political leanings, 
  which in turn predict people's stances on these political issues**.
* [This study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0095327X15575278) surveyed a group of mostly conservative 
  ROTC cadets and Academy cadets and found that a significant portion of them supported a transgender ban in the 
  military. Their typical respondent was "_at a military academy, male, white, nineteen or younger, leaning politically 
  to the right, Christian, and in their first (freshman) year of college._" The study also found that "_Although cadet 
  attitudes on the surface appear generally negative toward transgender people, **the findings have more to do with 
  context, sex, political, and religious beliefs** than military culture and affiliation exclusively._" **This means 
  that their beliefs about the transgender military ban were better explained by their politics than by their military 
  experience**.

If we do want to make a policy decision based on this, though, we could definitely consider improving unit cohesion by 
decreasing transphobic beliefs in the military, as more transphobic people seem to have more concerns about not being 
able to work with a trans person.

### Trump transgender military ban:

* ["DoD's Rationale for Reinstating the Transgender Ban Is Contradicted by Evidence" by the Palm Center, 2018](https://www.palmcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Transgender-troops-are-medically-fit-1.pdf)
    * **This was specifically written in response to 
      [a report published to justify the Trump administration's transgender military ban](https://www.lambdalegal.org/sites/default/files/legal-docs/downloads/dkt._216-2._dod_report_and_recommendations_feb_20181.pdf)**, 
      so it's specifically responding to the reasoning made for that ban.
        * Something worth noting is that this DoD Rationale 
          [may have been directed by explicitly right-wing, anti-trans activists like Ryan Anderson, Mike Pence, and Tony Perkins](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/trumps-new-trans-troops-ban-is-still-unconstitutional.html). 
          This makes the DoD's rationale less reliable as it may have been influenced by agenda-driven actors who are 
          willing to manipulate the evidence to achieve a certain end.
    * **The DoD report starts out with clearly unreasonable assumptions**, mainly that 
      [gender transition isn't particularly effective](#medical-transition). Of course, **this position goes against 
      nearly all of the existing academic literature** and so the DoD report has to cherry-pick 4 studies which still 
      backfires. From the Palm Center critique: "_Yet DoD's findings rely on a selective reading of scholarship. Despite 
      decades of peer-reviewed research, the Implementation Report could identify only four studies to sustain its 
      conclusion. Critically, even these four studies, supposedly representing the best evidence documenting the 
      uncertainty about transition-related care's efficacy, all conclude that such care mitigates symptoms of gender 
      dysphoria._"
    * The Palm Center argues that **the transgender ban would create a double standard for transgender people rather 
      than have everyone working along the same medical, fitness, and deployability standards**, an approach which 
      weakens the legitimacy of the existing military standards and serves to single out transgender people in a 
      discriminatory way.
    * The Palm Center also argues that **most trans troops are medically fit, using the DoD's own data to carry home the 
      point**: "_Out of 994 service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria in FY2016 and the first half of 2017, 393 
      (40 percent) deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation New Dawn. 
      Exactly one individual deploying with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria was unable to complete the deployment for 
      mental health reasons since policy protecting transgender personnel from arbitrary dismissal was established in 
      June 2016._"
    * The **transgender ban rationale has certain double standards when it comes to suicide attempts**, arguing that the 
      high suicide attempt  rate for transgender people should bar them from service while similar high-risk groups 
      oftentimes go ignored, e.g. children of service members (who have a 50% higher suicide attempt rate than the 
      general population). The rationale makes further mistakes with the use of suicidality in its reasoning, and of 
      course fails to account for the fact that **stigmatization of trans people (e.g. banning them from the military) 
      has a negative impact on suicidality**.
    * On the topic of unit cohesion, **the DoD Rationale provides no actual real-life evidence that trans inclusion 
      would harm cohesion**, instead only providing a handful of hypotheticals. These hypotheticals are dubious in and 
      of themselves and aren't enough to properly argue that trans people hurt unit cohesion.
    * In general, **the Rationale fails to consider opposing viewpoints, mainly by failing to address potential 
      downsides of a ban or considering possible missed benefits from inclusion**. The Rationale is not a balanced, 
      fair approach at the topic, but a one-sided approach which ends up ignoring valid points which oppose the 
      conclusion they want.

          dysphoria towards gender dysphoria rather than transness as a whole
        * Better guide medical researchers, policymakers, and the public regarding proper understanding of what it means

## Addressing Reactionary Claims

Some claims about trans people are addressed in 
[this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cx2skhMH-WhVi0VmoW-TQfZ-hbOBupAnsREmZfSAAoI/edit) by 
[this person](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrtaDFiK6Z-v0hqf3sNWhtA), if you want to take a look. 
[This webpage](https://transgendersg.com/myths/) and [this](https://transgendersg.com/trans-101-faq/) also have a lot 
of material to work with. Certain myths, e.g. those about [detransition](#detransitionregret), the 
[40% suicide statistic](#lets-talk-about-the-40-suicide-statistic-first), and 
[puberty blockers](#common-puberty-blocker-myths), have been addressed elsewhere in this doc.

WIP section but will probably cover:

* Mia Forstater and JK Rowling controversies
* The claim that trans people reinforce gender stereotypes

**Q: What about the failed [David Reimer case study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer), which was led by 
[John Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Money), who 
[introduced the gender-sex distinction](https://scihub.wikicn.top/10.1023/B:ASEB.0000014323.56281.0d)? Doesn't this 
failure not only suggest that his gender-sex distinction is flawed, gender roles are tied to nature rather than nurture, 
and that trans people by extension can't change their nature via transition?**

* It's highly encouraged that you read about the experiment and Reimer's life before trying to refute claims made about 
  them. His [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) is a good start, but there are a number of other [biographies](https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/david-reimer-and-john-money-gender-reassignment-controversy-johnjoan-case) and [articles](https://slate.com/technology/2004/06/why-did-david-reimer-commit-suicide.html) about him which could be worth reading through as well.
* The David Reimer case is tragic and Money should never have experimented with Reimer in the ways he did. Money covered 
  up the negative results of the experiment for years. There is no reason to defend the ethicality of this whatsoever.
* This does not properly represent the situation with trans people today, however. **Reimer was forced into a girl's 
  gender roles** at a young age and was given hormones basically at birth, unlike cases nowadays where **trans people 
  actively want to transition** rather than being forced into such. Reimer's case applies best to people who are forced 
  into transitioning despite not wanting it.
    * If anything, the Reimer case undermines anti-trans activists insofar that **it shows the harmful impacts of being 
      forced to live under a gender identity you didn't choose for yourself**. In this case, we see Reimer, a cis man, 
      suffer from being forced into a trans identity against his will. **This exact same situation could apply to a 
      trans person being forced into a cis identity** against their will - you just swap "cis" and "trans" with each other.
    * The comparison of Reimer to trans people today is further strengthened in that **Reimer basically had gender 
      dysphoria as a woman**, which is described in depth [in his long-term follow-up with Milton Diamond in 1997](https://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/1961to1999/1997-sex-reassignment.html):
        * "_There were little things from early on. I began to see how different I felt and was, from what I was 
          supposed to be. But I didn't know what it meant. I thought I was a freak or something; … I looked at myself 
          and said I don't like this type of clothing, I don't like the types of toys I was always being given, I like 
          hanging around with the guys and climbing trees and stuff like that and girls don't like any of that stuff. I 
          looked in the mirror and sees my shoulders are so wide, I mean there is nothing feminine about me. I'm skinny, 
          but other than that, nothing. But that is how I figured it out. [I figured I was a guy] but I didn't want to 
          admit it, I figured I didn't want to wind up opening a can of worms._"
        * "_Joan was put on an estrogen regimen from the age of 12 years but rebelled against taking the hormones. They 
          made her "feel funny" and she didn't want to feminize. She would often dispose of her daily dose. She 
          unhappily developed breasts but wouldn't wear a bra. Things came to a head at the age of 14. In discussing her 
          breast development with her endocrinologist she confessed "I suspected I was a boy since the second grade"._
* This specific case doesn't really disprove anything about [the gender-sex distinction](#gender-and-sex-are-different), 
  and the distinction has been validated by further research showing that your biological sex and gender identity don't 
  always align normally. This experiment is far better for proving the existence of gender being rooted mostly in 
  nature, a statement which might not even conflict with the concept of trans people (assuming their 
  [transgender identity also has neurological/biological basis](#neurologybiology)). In fact, **the primary focus of 
  Money's experiment was on the nature-nurture question**, not on if a gender-sex distinction was useful. Just because 
  Money, a bad person, introduced the distinction, that does not automatically make the distinction useless or bad.
    * **The gender-sex distinction is actually helpful for analyzing the Reimer experiment**. Here, we see that he has 
      a male **biological sex**, yet is forced into the **gender identity **of a woman. The sex-gender distinction is 
      pretty clearly in play with this analysis, proving itself to be useful.

**Q: Why didn't the medical community change courses on anything or drop any bad ideas after the Reimer experiment went 
wrong? Doesn't that indicate corruption and a leftist agenda?**

* Part of why the medical community didn't change in response to the bad results sooner is because those bad results 
  were covered up by Money for years. 
  [John Money boasted that his experiment had been a success](https://reason.com/2004/05/24/the-death-of-david-reimer/) 
  and the medical community accepted what he said as true for years, until David Reimer collaborated with Dr. Milton 
  Diamond and, in 1997, [published a long-term follow-up for Money's earlier experiments](https://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/1961to1999/1997-sex-reassignment.html) 
  which rebutted Money's research and got worldwide attention. Only then was the truth about Money's experiment actually 
  available to the medical community for them to actually make changes in response to.
* Once the medical community was aware of the truth, changes were made though. This case, which was mainly focused on 
  the nature-nurture question and gender plasticity, opened up that discussion while severely undermining the "it's 
  mostly nurture" side of the aisle. It also led to medical reforms on the issue of sex reassignment surgery for infants 
  with certain defects (e.g. micropenis). You can read more about that specifically 
  [here, in the Social Impact section](http://t-vox.org/history/people/david-reimer).

**Q: What if I identify as an attack helicopter, or as a different age? Should I be given the same respect in my 
identity as trans people want for themselves?**

* This is a false analogy on its face, helicopters and different ages are not analogous to gender identity; helicopters 
  aren't even socially constructed ([while gender is](#gender-and-sex-are-different)) and age, while being a social
  construct (humans constructed the measurement of time via years, months, etc.), is not tied to the certain behaviors or 
  identification of a person like gender is.
* The comparison made implicitly assumes that men and women are about as different as humans are to helicopters, which 
  is clearly a bad analogy to use here. As it turns out, men and women are both human and share a lot beyond that while 
  helicopters aren't even sentient.
* This started out as a dumb joke, and isn't well-equipped at all to be an actual argument. Anyone who uses this as a 
  legitimate argument has no idea what they're talking about.
* [This page](https://transgendersg.com/trans-101-faq/) gives a different approach to the attack helicopter arg.

**(WORK IN PROGRESS) Q: What if I identify as an attack helicopter, or as a different age? Should I be given the same 
respect in my identity as trans people want for themselves?**

* There's a couple of things implied with this argument, which we'll refute here.
    * **Certain things don't fit within the parameters of gender identity/expression (e.g. identifying as an attack 
      helicopter because attack helicopter is a gender or the sort)**. Gender expression deals specifically with how a 
      person chooses to express themselves within society as a human being. Gender does NOT deal with whether people are 
      human, dogs, attack helicopters, etc.
        * People already recognize this insofar as they know being a human, dog, cat, etc. is different from being a 
          boy or a girl. Masculine dogs exist alongside feminine dogs, and these dogs are able to present themselves as 
          masculine and feminine while still being dogs. Heck, sometimes people even apply gender identificative terms 
          to inanimate things, e.g. countries ("Mother Russia" or the "Fatherland" for Germany) and referring to war 
          ships in a feminine way ([which is a traditional thing to do, not a new SJW soyface thing](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/why-do-ships-have-a-gender)).
    * Some people will argue "if I can identify or express myself as a woman, why can't I express myself as being a 
      different age or height or whatever?" These people don't know that **the parameters of gender identity/expression 
      don't necessarily apply to other things (e.g. age or height)**. 

**Q: What about [Ray Blanchard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Blanchard)'s theory of 
[autogynephilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanchard%27s_transsexualism_typology#Autogynephilia), the idea that most 
or all trans women are trans because of erotic arousal by the thought of being a woman?**

* Most evidence supporting the theory was published by Blanchard himself prior to 2003, after which his theory and 
  methodology were both criticized.
* [https://juliaserano.blogspot.com/2015/07/the-real-autogynephilia-deniers.html](https://juliaserano.blogspot.com/2015/07/the-real-autogynephilia-deniers.html) 
  is nice roundup of the research surrounding autogynephilia.

**Q: People with [anorexia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa) are treated with psychiatric help, not
hormones or surgery. Why can't we do the same for trans people?**

* There's a crucial set of differences between people with anorexia and those with gender dysphoria.
    * People with anorexia are wrong from the outset when they assume they are overweight, when they're not. When a 
      person with gender dysphoria thinks they don't pass as their desired gender, they're usually not wrong at all, 
      especially if they haven't gone through any sort of transition to their desired gender yet.
    * Anorexic people usually respond well to psychiatric treatment, whereas the similar curative/conversion therapy 
      option for trans people has yet to emerge as a successful treatment. As for affirmation, trans people 
      [respond well to affirmation](#medical-transition) whereas affirming anorexic people's beliefs don't lead to good 
      results (and any good results from starving an underweight person are probably outweighed by convincing them 
      they're not overweight to begin with).
* Some people cite [body dysmorphic disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder) instead of 
  anorexia specifically. The same basic framework applies between anorexia and BDD.
* While gender dysphoria and BDD/anorexia are not really comparable in the way of treatments, it's important to note 
  that [they can happen in relation to each other](https://centerfordiscovery.com/blog/gender-dysphoria-body-dysmorphia-trans-non-binary-folks/). 
  For example, someone who is very conscious about their body image due to dysphoria might develop BDD as a result of 
  that anxiety. However, that doesn't justify approaching both gender dysphoria and BDD with the same treatments.
* This talking point is addressed [here](https://transgendersg.com/trans-101-faq/) as well.

**Q: Don't you need dysphoria to be trans?**

Similar to the [gender-sex distinction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q04ryP_d-smtSSwXkDATFQd-4UcQBlgpfWULdvLgh2M/edit#heading=h.9a00yzaqmnp8), 
the answer to this question largely comes down to semantics. It also comes down to whether or not some trans people have
managed to get rid of their dysphoria. Let's start with the semantic aspect. Below are a number of medical organizations 
cited where they implicitly or explicitly say that not all transgender people have to deal with gender dysphoria:

If that's not convincing, let's go on to that second part: if you have a transgender person who used to have dysphoria, 
but has now gone through so-and-so procedures and now feels in line with their body, no longer feels dysphoric... is 
that person no longer transgender? Obviously not. So that again goes to show that you can be transgender without 
necessarily having dysphoria.

### Specific Studies and Articles:

* [Dhejne et al. 11](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885) (sometimes referred 
  to as the Sweden study), study name "_Long-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery: 
  Cohort Study in Sweden_"
    * **Commonly cited by anti-trans activists to indicate sexual reassignment surgery harms trans people, increases 
      risk of suicide.**
    * This is **NOT** what the study says.
        * A study proving that SRS harms trans people would compare the wellbeing of post-SRS trans people to pre-SRS 
          trans people, but this one uses** CIS** people as a control group. Because of this, we can only use the data 
          to compare certain trans people to the cis population - we can't compare pre-SRS to post-SRS with this data.
        * An excerpt from the study - "_no inferences can be drawn as to the effectiveness of sex reassignment as a 
          treatment for transsexualism. In other words, **the results should not be interpreted such as sex reassignment 
          per se increases morbidity and mortality**. Things might have been even worse without sex reassignment._"
        * The study merely demonstrates that trans people who have had SRS **still are a vulnerable population** 
          compared to cis people, but NOT that their condition had been worsened by SRS.
    * The head author, Cecilia Dhejne, is actually very trans positive herself, and describes her intent in publishing 
      this study in [this Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6q3e8v/science_ama_series_im_cecilia_dhejne_a_fellow_of/dkuk2tr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). 
      She also clarifies what the study says in [this interview](https://www.transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm).
        * From the Reddit AMA: "_I have said many times that the study is not design to evaluate the outcome of medical 
          transition. It DOES NOT say that medical transition causes people to commit suicide._"
        * From [a different published work by Dhejne directly summarizing the study](https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/handle/10616/45580): 
          "_This study cannot determine the effectiveness of gender-affirming medical intervention_"
    * On top of all of this, [a different study also focused on Sweden](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-009-9551-1) 
      reaffirmed that SRS leads to satisfaction in the long run (though this one had 5 years of data while the Dhejne 
      study had 20 years).
    * Something important to note about the time period of this study is that **societal attitudes toward transgender
      people may have changed during the study's timeframe**, between 1973 and 2003. The same is true for transgender 
      healthcare itself. This means that the outcomes of transitioning in 1970 could very well differ from the outcomes
      of transition in 1990.
        * "_In accordance, the **overall mortality rate was only significantly increased for the group operated before
          1989**. However, the latter might also be explained by improved health care for transsexual persons during \[the\] 
          1990s, along with altered societal attitudes towards persons with different gender expressions._"

      (17 minutes in).
    * This study is also cited to prove that "trans women retain male pattern violence" and was misrepresented so much 
      that the author herself had an interview to discuss how that's not what the study is saying. [This article by Gemma Stone](https://medium.com/@notCursedE/do-trans-women-retain-male-pattern-violence-df67954373fd) 
      goes over this specific talking point.

      youthtranscriticalprofessionals_'. Parents who frequent these sites will have already been conditioned to doubt 
      their kids' trans identity, so will be much more likely to subscribe to ROGD as a justification for their beliefs. 
      **This is already reason enough to dismiss the study as a proof of ROGD** - it's hard to get any reliable 
      conclusions out of bad data.
        * On top of this, **the study specifically targeted parents who would fit the ROGD hypothesis**, reaching out 
          to "_[parents of teens who became convinced they were the opposite sex after a steady diet of social media and/or peer influence](https://4thwavenow.com/2016/07/02/rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-new-study-recruiting-parents/)_". 
          This sample was probably recruited with intent to prove that ROGD is a big thing, or at the very least to 
          prove that gender dysphoria is a social contagion.
        * It also doesn't help that the idea for ROGD [first surfaced via these specific websites](https://juliaserano.blogspot.com/2019/02/origins-of-social-contagion-and-rapid.html) 
          (though Littman popularized the term "Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria") and not from previous scientific inquiry 
          (Littman's study was the first one ever on ROGD!), which further suggests that these specific websites were 
          hand-picked by Littman to prove a specific hypothesis.
    * Furthermore, **the study polled parents instead of children, which makes the data even less reliable**. While 
      polling parents isn't always a bad thing, it really undermines this particular study for a number of reasons:
        * Parent evaluations vs children self-evaluations tend to differ substantially when it comes to mental health, 
          and is even more an issue when the parents are stressed about it ([as detailed here in the 4th paragraph](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212578)). 
          Parents of trans kids who frequent websites about a "transgender craze" going down are probably going to be 
          stressed because they'll think their kid is involved in this craze.
        * **What appears to a parent to be a "rapid" onset may not have been rapid for their child at all**, as 
          closeted LGBTQ children tend to stay closeted for a while before coming out (they still fear [discrimination/rejection by their family](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q04ryP_d-smtSSwXkDATFQd-4UcQBlgpfWULdvLgh2M/edit#heading=h.agcl0vdpee8o), 
          among other things) and during this time they'll get a better sense of their gender identity or sexual 
          orientation. When a gay or trans person comes out of the closet to their parents, what the kids had to process 
          over the course of months or years is processed by parents over the course of mere days - so what looks like a 
          rapid change to parents could easily be anything but rapid to trans children.
    * Even if we are dealing with something which is genuinely rapid-onset, not just from the parent's view but also 
      from the child's, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. [To quote from Julia Serano](https://juliaserano.medium.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-1940b8afdeba): 
      "**_There is nothing inherently erroneous or illegitimate about a "rapid" onset of gender dysphoria — some trans 
      people experience an epiphany during which all the clues and puzzle pieces suddenly come together, and they 
      finally realize that they are transgender._**" This just goes further to show that the element of social contagion 
      still might not be supported by this study, even if we assume the data is 100% accurate.
    * Multiple other important critiques are made [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-019-1453-2) 
      if you want a look, this gives a lot more insight into how Littman's study is flawed (including criticism of the 
      DSM-5 model used).
    * **"But, the study got censored and suppressed by the activist left! Even disregarding flaws, doesn't that suggest 
      a biased academia?"**
        * The study was never even pulled from the journal it was published in, despite its many flaws; 
          [it's still there and available in full](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330). 
          That's not suppression and that's not censorship.
        * As for the Brown University press release on the study, **it was retracted not due to a political agenda but 
          because of concerns raised about the study quality and design** - which definitely exist for this study. 
          Suppressing a _press release_ (not the actual study) on a badly designed, fatally flawed study is not a bad 
          thing to do. See the "Expanded Brown University Statement – Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2018" linked 
          [here](https://www.brown.edu/news/2019-03-19/gender).
        * Regardless, there's been a good amount of debate on the merits of Littman's study. A good example of this in 
          play would be [from](https://juliaserano.medium.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-1940b8afdeba)

          about the study. Keep in mind that [criticizing a study isn't the same as trying to censor it](https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/08/rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-study-criticism-is-not-censorship-its-good-science.html).
    * **"But, the study also found that kids going through ROGD also consumed a lot of trans media and/or had trans 
      friends! Doesn't that suggest social contagion?"**
        * You could just as easily suggest that the situation is actually flipped - **it makes sense for a closeted 
          person with gender dysphoria to seek out other people with gender dysphoria**, rather than vice versa. 
          Marginalized groups of people tend to seek out one another to get advice or feel comforted by someone whose 
          experiences they can relate to. This applies to a trans person who is closeted (in which case the parents 
          wouldn't know their kid was trans until the kid comes out as trans). In fact, it's well documented that gay
          people reach out to gay communities for help to come out of the closet, as it is for people of various political 
          ideologies when they deal with coming out to their loved ones (most commonly a conservative coming out to 
          their liberal family or vice versa). This same sort of process happens with trans people and trans 
          communities.

    * **The study claims that hormonal therapy does not help reduce testosterone levels to that of a cis woman's.**
    * However, the study uses the testosterone blocker known as Spiro, which inhibits testosterone receptors rather than 
      stopping its production, making the data useless. On the other hand, 
      [a different study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15476439/) ([non-paywall](https://eje.bioscientifica.com/downloadpdf/journals/eje/151/4/425.pdf)) 
      using Cypro (a testosterone blocker that actually lowers testosterone in the blood) shows testosterone levels 
      lower than average female levels. This doesn't mean that HRT doesn't reduce testosterone, but only that a certain 
      form of HRT isn't that effective.

    * **Cited by anti-trans activists to indicate that gender inclusion policies in store changing rooms leads to a 
      large increase in sexual offences.**
    * **BAD DATA COLLECTION:** The study uses **media reports from Google searches**, which is a horrific way to collect 
      data on actual sexual offences.
        * If a single incident gets reported on by multiple outlets, that may have been counted as multiple incidents 
          by the study.
        * The amount of reporting on these incidents in Target stores may have had an uptick after the policy was 
          passed as more people were interested in those particular sorts of incidents.
    * **Most cases recorded [in the database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oju2lck3TJVFKTAm7neinY7-tq1fQfS3IhPOyvqq3Kw/edit#gid=302670011)
      did not even take place in the changing rooms or bathrooms**, which is what the 
      [gender non-discriminatory policy](https://corporate.target.com/article/2016/04/target-stands-inclusivity) 
      affected, but rather the store floor (using ctrl + f, there were 17 mentions of 'washroom, '50 mentions of 
      'changeroom,' and 155 mentions of 'store' (as in store floor) on the database).
    * Despite the vast majority of upskirt incidents happening on the store floor (97.1%), with, again, store floors 
      not being affected by the policy, and the vast majority of peeping tom incidents happening in changing rooms and 
      bathrooms (98.4%), **both went up by almost the exact same rate**:_ 'In a Poisson regression, using trimesters to 
      control for seasonal variations in offenses,the fold change in rate from the four year pre-policy period to the 
      post-policy period was 3.03 for Upskirt and 3.14 for Peeping Tom.'_ This means **the policy can explain almost 
      none of the rise in these cases**, but rather most likely the methodology (as it relies only on media reports). 
      **And these numbers are from the study itself**!
    * It is not peer reviewed and published on _Woman Means Something_, a TERF website.

# GENDER AND SEX

## Gendered Behavior

**At a young age, children learn and copy perceived a lot of gendered behavior, which in many cases leads to the 
limiting of children's expression. This doesn't necessarily prove that _all_ gendered norms have a firm basis in 
nurture, that's something that this doc hasn't adequately addressed yet.**

**Note: this section is really in need of a re-haul, it isn't necessarily representative of the general science here, 
and it's also vague on how much of gendered norms are nurtured as opposed to natured.**

## Gender and Sex are Different

**Modern science also recognizes an important distinction between gender and sex. See another brief without links in 
[this section](#medical-consensus).**

Whether or not gender and sex are distinct basically depends entirely on how we define those ideas in the first place. 

* [National Institute of Health](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sex-gender)
    * "_"Sex" refers to biological differences between females and males, including chromosomes, sex organs, and 
      endogenous hormonal profiles. "Gender" refers to socially constructed and enacted roles and behaviors which occur 
      in a historical and cultural context and vary across societies and over time._"
    * [More reading from the NIH.](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2016/05/sex-gender)
* [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf)
    * "_Sex refers especially to physical and biological traits, whereas GENDER refers especially to social or cultural 
      traits_"
* [Stanford University](http://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/terms/gender.html)
    * "_Gender refers to sociocultural attitudes and behaviors that shape behaviors, products, technologies, 
      environments, and knowledges... Gender may not match sex._"
* [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/genomics/gender/en/)
    * "_'Gender' describes those characteristics of women and men that are largely socially created, while 'sex' 
      encompasses those that are biologically determined_"
* [Canadian Institutes of Health Research](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/48642.html)
    * "_Sex refers to a set of biological attributes in humans and animals. It is primarily associated with physical 
      and physiological features including chromosomes, gene expression, hormone levels and function, and 
      reproductive/sexual anatomy._"
    * "_Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, expressions and identities of girls, women, boys, 
      men, and gender diverse people. It influences how people perceive themselves and each other, how they act and 
      interact, and the distribution of power and resources in society._"
* [National Health Service (UK)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/)
    * "_Most people identify as "male" or "female". These are sometimes called "binary" identities. But some people 
      feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex._"
    * **Doesn't explicitly say 'gender and sex are different'** but still assumes the distinction exists.
* [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2021/03/health-care-for-transgender-and-gender-diverse-individuals)
    * Defines "gender identity" and "sex" separately.
    * "_Gender Identity: A person's internal sense of self and how they fit into the world, from the perspective of 
      gender._"
    * "_Sex: Historically has referred to the sex assigned at birth, based on assessment of external genitalia, as well 
      as chromosomes and gonads. In everyday language is often used interchangeably with gender, **however there are 
      differences**, which become important in the context of transgender people._"
    * Difference between biological sex and gender identity is assumed when they define "gender dysphoria": "_Gender 
      Dysphoria: Distress that accompanies the incongruence **between one's experienced and expressed gender and one's 
      assigned or natal gender**._"
    * An [older version of the same page](https://web.archive.org/web/20210214185000/https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/01/care-for-transgender-adolescents) 
      more directly got the point across: "_Gender identity is a person's fundamental and innate sense of being male, 
      female, or somewhere in between. For transgender individuals, **their gender identity differs from their natal 
      gender** (the gender they were assigned at birth)._"
* Some extra stuff on this:
    * [https://drive.google.com/file/d/18wWhHSYWEc2iPriCdV5p1X2daSj3n64I/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18wWhHSYWEc2iPriCdV5p1X2daSj3n64I/view)
    * [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PlV4kUcVVg1xUnkMFJiUuPMD6eZ7vXSRLGufIv_PIVw/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PlV4kUcVVg1xUnkMFJiUuPMD6eZ7vXSRLGufIv_PIVw/edit)
    * [https://www.healthline.com/health/sex-vs-gender](https://www.healthline.com/health/sex-vs-gender)

Some things to keep in mind:

* Definitions and word meanings can change with time, they aren't necessarily rooted in one place. If society begins to 
  recognize a distinction between two synonyms, this isn't necessarily abnormal nor necessarily bad.
* Words can have different meanings depending on context. While in a casual context gender and sex might be used 
  interchangeably, in academic/expert spaces the two words have distinct meanings. This sort of common-expert 
  distinction in word use is actually rather common, so it's not particularly surprising to see something like this happen.
* A sex/gender distinction is already used in practice to describe trans people
    * [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transgender) defines transgender as being "_of, 
      relating to, or being a person **whose gender identity differs from the sex** the person had or was identified as 
      having at birth._"
    * [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/247649) defines transgender as 
      "_Designating a person whose **sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond to that person's sex at 
      birth**, or which does not otherwise conform to conventional notions of sex and gender._"
* This gender/sex distinction is a semantic difference, so it **doesn't need to be proven with studies**. This is a 
  distinction that exists because the relevant medical communities defined the words "gender" and "sex" differently to 
  fit these specific niches in that medical context. Asking for a study to prove the distinction is like asking for a 
  study which proves that happiness and sadness semantically are not the same thing - obviously "happiness" and 
  "sadness" are referring to different concepts because we defined those words like that. What matters here is that we 
  recognize the situation is really just two different words defining two different concepts.
    * "Two different concepts? What?" Let's look at that bit 
      [using the NIH's definitions](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sex-gender):
        * _"Sex" refers to biological differences between females and males, including chromosomes, sex organs, and 
          endogenous hormonal profiles._
        * _"Gender" refers to socially constructed and enacted roles and behaviors which occur in a historical and 
          cultural context and vary across societies and over time._
    * Would you agree that these two words are defined differently, and that they are referring to different concepts? 
      Sex is being defined in reference to biological stuff, while gender is defined in reference to more socially 
      constructed stuff. We don't need a study to prove that these two words are referring to two different concepts.

**An analogy to help explain the distinction between gender and sex, with a focus on age** (complementing biological 
sex in that it's more concrete and unchangeable) **and maturity** (complementing gender identity in that it's socially 
constructed):

* James is 16 years old. You'd expect him to be whatever brash, obnoxious, reckless person you'd expect a 16-year-old 
  to be - but he covers his family's bills, he works a job to take care of his siblings, and he's basically acting as 
  an adult even though he is 16 years old and is expected to be irresponsible and rowdy. He's grown out of being a child 
  and effectively acts as an adult. You could point out that he's 16 and that he is still legally a child, but the way 
  he acts, how he presents, and who and where he hangs around effectively means his actions reflect that of a mature 
  adult.
* Here, we've essentially substituted biological sex for age (instead of being male or female, the focus is now your 
  age) and maturity for gender (this is the more socially constructed side of things). Even though we regularly 
  associate different ages with different levels of maturity (similarly to how gender and sex are intertwined), we're 
  still able to recognize how these are distinct concepts which aren't always tied together in the same way, i.e. 
  childish adults and mature youth.
* Even though immaturity is associated with young people and maturity with adults, we see James breaking that norm by 
  being both mature and a young person. Similarly, even though we expect men to act in a certain way and women a certain 
  way, transgender people break that norm insofar as they pick up social roles not associated with their biological sex.

## Gender in the Past

**We didn't always hold the same attitudes or use the same terminology for genders that we do now.**

* [History Extra: BBC](https://www.historyextra.com/period/great-misconception/)
    * Interesting origins of gendered terms and raising children.
    * _"Nor have boys always even been called boys. **Until the late 15th century the word 'girl' simply means a child 
      of either sex**. Boys, where they had to be differentiated, were referred to as 'knave girls' and girls in the 
      female sense were called 'gay girls'. Equally a boy could be a 'knave child' and a girl a 'maiden child'. The 
      term 'boy' was reserved for servants or 'churls', the meaning 'young man' probably deriving from the latter as a 
      pejorative term but not occurring before 1440."_
* [Newman 15](https://aeon.co/essays/whatever-happened-to-the-noble-art-of-the-manly-weep)
    * **It used to be considered manly to cry** - not just in one place at one time, but in multiple societies at 
      different points in history.
    * _Note: Non-academic and non-expert, but still useful._
* [Oláh et al. 14](http://www.familiesandsocieties.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WP11OlahEtAl2014.pdf)
    * Gendered behaviours and associated responsibilities have seen some changes even in recent times. For example:
        * Women have consistently become more involved in working for money and bringing income home (pg 11)
        * Women are now having a much greater presence in higher education, out-graduating males in college (pg 17)
        * Fathers are now more expected to take a role in childcare, though in most instances mothers do the majority 
          of childcare work (pg 29)
* [Haig 04](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B%3AASEB.0000014323.56281.0d)
    * **As late as the 1960s, "gender" was rarely used in the social sciences** nor in the scientific community in 
      general, **back when we didn't know as much about sex and gender as we do now.**
    * **When it was introduced it was done specifically with a gender-sex distinction in mind**: "_Money (1996) later 
      wrote that he imported the term gender into sexological science "to make it possible to write about people who 
      came into one's office as either male or female, but of whom it could not be said that their sex role in the 
      specific genital sense was either male or female insofar as they had a history of birth defect of the sex organs._"
        * Yes, Money did introduce the word - "_Excluding grammatical uses, most, if not all, of the gender-containing 
          titles in SCI and SSCI from the 1960s appear to have derived the term from Money._"
        * Keep in mind this is also the Money who's 
          [infamous for child abuse and a failed transitioning project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) 
          (addressed [here](#addressing-reactionary-claims)), that's bad.

## Gender Equality Paradox

**Gender essentialists claim that gender differences career choices remain even in highly egalitarian countries - named         
the gender equality paradox. This claim is founded on a poor study which the academic community rejects and ridicules. 
See the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-equality_paradox).**

* [Richardson et al 18](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619872762?journalCode=pssa)
    * A **peer reviewed** paper published by the **same journal** cities conceptual and empirical problems with the 
      "gender-equality paradox in STEM" hypothesis.
    * The researchers revealed that the Soet et al. 18 paper had omissions and inconsistencies in their research, namely 
      inconsistent and undisclosed modification of the source data and a poorly conceived methodology.
      [This warranted a correction from Stoet et al. by the publisher](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619892892).
    * The authors conclude a "nonsignificant correlation between nation-level gender equality and women in STEM when 
      measures of gender equality and STEM achievement were changed indicates that the association is sensitive to 
      choice of measures of gender equality, range  of countries, and STEM achievement."
        * National-level indicators of gender equality are a poor metric for discerning causal relationships between 
          gender equality and percentages of women in STEM.
* [Breda et al. 20](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/49/31063)
    * Researchers empirically show that there is a **much stronger correlation** between the **strength of gender 
      stereotypes** in math-related fields and **differences in intention to study math-related fields** between boys 
      and girl.
    * The paper explains the gender-math stereotype as a combination of various theories:
        * A way for dominant groups to differentiate themselves
        * According to evolutionary theory, social differentiation to achieve more cooperation between individuals by 
          creating smaller subgroups with clear boundaries 
        * Members of wealthier and more egalitarian countries tend to fall back to gender-essentialist norms for 
          self-identification and self-expression
        * The importance of math between developed and developing countries
        * The strength of parent involvement in education creating more chances for spreading gender-stereotypes

## Addressing Misconceptions about Gender and Sex

* **"But sex is determined by chromosomes! XX for women and XY for men."**
    * What about people with XXX, or XYY, or other combinations? 
      [These people do exist](https://www.who.int/genomics/gender/en/index1.html). The XX/XY dichotomy doesn't include 
      these people, and thus does not reflect the real world fully and accurately. The XX/XY dichotomy is still useful 
      for everyday use as it includes most people, but if we're looking for accuracy over convenience, we can't ignore 
      those who have uncommon chromosome sets.
* **"Intersex people are too uncommon to be relevant, so they don't count."**
    * [The frequency of intersex people is unclear](https://isna.org/faq/frequency/) for a number of reasons (opening 
      up for a wide range of estimates), but let's settle for a broad definition: "people whose bodies differ from 
      standard male or female". The Intersex Society of North America (linked earlier) suggests that this applies to 1 
      in every 100 births. While that may seem like a small number at first, if we scale that up to all of humanity we 
      end up with nearly 80 million people. 
      [That's larger than most countries are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population) - certainly 
      not an insignificant number.
    * Other estimates go even higher, 
      [going up to 2% of births](https://www.intersexequality.com/how-common-is-intersex-in-humans/) - that's about as 
      common as red haired people are.
    * It's important to emphasize that intersex is not just defined by one trait like ambiguous genitalia, but is rather 
      defined by a broader grouping of abnormal sex characteristics. Some of the lower range estimates may have only 
      considered one or two traits rather than expand their scope to account for the whole range of intersex people. As 
      quoted from [here](https://www.intersexequality.com/how-common-is-intersex-in-humans/), "_Some groups use an old 
      prevalence statistic that says we make up 1 in 2000, or .05%, percent of the population, but that statistic refers 
      to one specific intersex trait, ambiguous genitalia, which is but one of many variations which, combined (as they 
      are in medical diagnostics and coding), constitute the 1.7% estimate by esteemed Professor of Biology and Gender 
      Studies, Anne Fausto-Sterling, of Brown University*. A similar, slightly higher, statistic was also reported in,
      "How Sexually Dimorphic Are We?", by Blackless, et al., in The American Journal of Human Biology._"
    * Even if intersex people only make up a fraction of a % of all people, that still doesn't mean that we can just 
      ignore them - [Jews for example make up around 0.2% of the world population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_religious_groups), 
      but nobody says that Judaism isn't a religion.
* **"Intersex people are all infertile, so they don't count."**
    * Infertility doesn't automatically exclude you from being of a sex or etc. - for example, 
      [many women struggle with infertility](https://resolve.org/how-many-people-have-infertility/) (though it is a 
      somewhat vague term) yet we don't consider those women to not be women or to not be of any sex.
    * Regardless, not all intersex people are sterile, and in fact 
      [plenty of intersex people end up going through forced sterilization](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/112848/9789241507325_eng.pdf) 
      during their lifetimes, implying that they were not sterilized prior to going through the forced sterilization 
      process.
* **"Can you name all the genders? If not, your take is invalid."**
    * This question is a bit dishonest. It's like taking a color wheel and asking for a number for how many colors 
      there are.
    * ![How many colors are there](images/how-many-colors-are-there.png "How many colors are there")
    * Gender as a concept (socially constructed and something which varies based on the specific person) is comparable 
      to emotions and personalities. Basically, **there's ways to express yourself which are basically qualitative, not 
      quantitative - emotions and personalities, and of course, gender**. How many emotions exist? How many 
      personalities? There is no true answer to how many personalities exist or how many emotions exist. These are 
      qualitative ideas, just like gender.
        * Yes, people do try to categorize ideas like emotions and personalities, just as people categorize gender. 
          [Here's an emotion color wheel](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/614966433281212433/812129928484749352/emotion_wheel2_colour.png) 
          which does just that.
        * This comparison is further strengthened by **the role they all play in personal identity**. Personalities, 
          emotions, gender, etc. all have a role in shaping who you are as a person and how you interact with the world 
          around you.
    * If you're confused about how the word "gender" is being used in this context, you might want to see 
      [this section](#gender-and-sex-are-different) for clarification. "Gender" is being used to refer to the socially 
      constructed and cultural side of the coin, while "sex" refers more strictly to the biological side of the coin.
* **"Gender and sex are basically the same thing because they have a correlative or causative relationship, or because 
  they're intertwined, etc."**
    * Two things having a causative connection doesn't make them literally the same thing. You could say that education 
      and income have a causative connection - people with higher education levels are more able to reach well paying 
      jobs as they're more qualified for them - but that doesn't mean that education and income are the same thing.
    * The idea that "sex determines your gender" already assumes that assumes gender and sex are two distinct things, 
      that this one distinct thing determines this other distinct thing - this completely undermines the idea that 
      they're the same.
* **"Men are men and women are women. That means a man can't be a woman nor vice versa."**
    * "Men are men and women are women" is tautological and therefore meaningless. It's like saying "the sky is the sky 
      and blue is blue", it doesn't really mean anything.
    * Upon clarification, they might clarify "what I'm trying to say is that it's impossible to change the sex you're 
      born as". The problem is that trans people are not changing their sex, they are changing their gender. This 
      usually loops the conversation back to whether or not there's a gender-sex distinction, which in turn is addressed 
      [here](#gender-and-sex-are-different).
